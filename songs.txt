I'll pick you up early
From the school gates at 3:30
I'll take you down Soho
Be ready to Go-Go
The perverts will be ready
The queue it will be steady
I'll charge you 50 percent
And then I'll charge you for the rent

Am I bad?
Yes, he's bad
Am I bad?
Yes, he's bad

I'll feed you narcotics
Make sure you're erotic
And then I'll feed some to your pals
And soon I'll have a chain of gals
I'll wait outside your school
I'll seem so nice, I'll seem so cool
In my expensive car
I promise I'll make you a star

Am I bad?
Yes, he's bad
Am I bad?
Yes, he's bad

I'll get you a modelling contract
Just lie here on your back
And let perverts stick it in
And leer at you with sickly grins
My paedophile ring, it's the best
My customers they all attest
So come on perverts, come on down
I've got the best ring in the town

Am I bad?
Yes, he's bad
Am I bad?
Yes, he's bad
Am I bad?
Yes, he's bad
Am I bad?
Yes, he's bad

I keep it in the family
All my daughters work for me


I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha

I could've been a killer
Who thought that he was God
My victims all mere mortals
All filthy dogs

I could've, I could've, I could've, should've been
A killing, killing, killing, killing, killing machine

I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha

I could've been a killer
Who ate his victims' flesh
I could've eat them rotten
I could've eat them fresh

I could've, I could've, I could've, I could've, I could've, could've been
A killing, killing, killing machine

I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha

I could've been a killer

I could've been a killer
Children suffocate
Then laughed at all the mothers
Whose hearts I did break

I could've, could've, could've, could've, could've, could've been
A killing, killing, killing, killing, killing machine

Yeah, I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha

And I could've been a killer

I could've been a killer
Who thought that he was God
My victims all mere mortals
All filthy dogs

I could've, I could've, I could've, should've been
A killing, killing, killing, killing, killing machine

Yeah, I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
I could have been a killer, ha-ha-ha-ha
Killing machine
Killing machine


Goodbye, English Rose

You hit that concrete pillar hard
You knew you could not win
And shards of glass have pierced
Your organs and your skin
Your arteries, your arteries, your arteries were slashed
Well I suppose we've all got to die sometime
You died in a car crash

Well, you took that concrete pillar
And it has bashed you in
You took that corner far too fast
Your chances they were slim
Your arteries, your arteries, your arteries were slashed
Well I suppose we've all got to die sometime
You died in a car crash

Well, they rushed you off to hospital
And turned off the machine
But all what was left was to notify
Your royal next of kin
Your arteries, your arteries, your arteries were slashed
Well I suppose we've all got to die sometime
You died in a car crash
The car crash
The car crash
The car crash
Crash
Crash
Crash
Crash
A car crash


He picks you up, in his car,
He opens every orifice and scar.
Maria, Maria

He cuts you down, in your prime
You will not wither or decline.
Maria, Maria

He tortures you, he holds you down
He beats you black, blue, green and brown.
Maria, Maria

He murders you, he takes your life
For Satan, Satan, Satan's light.
Maria, Maria
Maria, Maria

He feasts on you from dusk to dawn
His knife your body will transform.
Maria, Maria

Your hair so long, your hair so brown
Now in his evil, in his evil you do drown.
Maria, Maria

He drinks your blood as holy wine,
Now in his evil you decline.
Maria, Maria
Maria, Maria
Maria, Maria


I like burning houses down, and factories as well.
I like burning anything, it's the truth I tell.
Libraries and museums, both of them have fell,
I like burning things, burning things is swell.

I would like to start it as a fashion trend,
Amongst the young people, then the world might end.
Wouldn't it be fun, to ring the funeral bell,
On our civilization, and watch it burn in Hell.

Start a fire, start a fire, start a fire today.
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it all away.

Fire! Fire!

In the summer I like to go to the country side,
Where I burn a forest down, I watch it burn with pride.
Isn't nature wonderful, it makes things so dry,
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn the country side.

Start a fire, start a fire, start a fire today
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it all away.

Fire! Fire!

It makes me feel so sad to see young people dance,
They could burn the discotheque down, they've got every chance.
Then they'd get themselves into the news,
Burning things, burning things can make you famous too.

Start a fire, start a fire, start a fire today
Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it all away.

Fire! Fire!

Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it all away.


Well, you've always got schoolbooks
You've always got toys
You never go hungry like
Some of the boys
But something is not quite right
It's not what it seems
Soho's best dressed boy
He doesn't feel clean

Father - no father, but
Uncles you've had
They all turned out nasty
They all turned out bad
They were all pimps
And they were all hoods
So Soho's best dressed boy
Doesn't feel good

They sent you away
To a school for the Toffs
Where you learned to speak proper
And you learned to speak posh
Your mother she cried
Your mother felt sad
So Soho's best dressed boy
He's feeling bad

Took you a long time to find out the truth
Your mother a whore all through your youth

Your mother she died
A long time ago
The ways of the world
Well, now you do know
You stand by her gravestone
You say it out loud
She was a prostitute
And you feel proud


Wake up every morning
Take a coffee down
Then it's in the tube train
In the rush hour to drown
Well, your wife she fucks a neighbour
And calls you a jerk
And when you find out you go berserk
You take a poker to her
And you ram it up her arse
Then you wrap it around her skull
And then you laugh
Well, the neighbour knew you did it
And he turns you in
Now you're gonna pay for your sins
The judge calls you an animal
And says if he could
He'd give you the death sentence -
That would be good
Well, the jury don't take long to establish your guilt
After all, you are guilty, guilty, guilty to the hilt
Well, they found you in your prison cell
Hanging by the neck - your life you had wrecked
And your children they forget you when they can
And when they don't forget you, your memory
Your memory they damn
So now you're rotting in the flames of hell
With a poker rammed up your ass
And around your skull as well


She sang like an angel
To the chattering plates
But your pimp and your pusher
You both thought were great
Well, you earned enough money
To pay for your stuff
It's great having brown skin
It doesn't show up

You sang like an angel
To the chattering cups
At the end of the day
You weren't tough enough
Your pimp and your pusher
Well, they beat you up
Well, It's great having brown skin
It doesn't show up

Well, your voice became sand-paper
Sand-paper worn
As your heart it was broken
Your heart it was torn
And when you died
The police all queued up
It's great having brown skin
It doesn't show up


A is for the Anger
B is for the Bile
C is for the Caustic nature of my smile
D, E and F are Dread, Envy and Fear
G and H - the Greed and Hatred I feel through the years
I is for my Ignorance
J - my jaundiced views
K is for the Knowledge that I refuse to use
L is for the Loathing
And M for Maliciousness
And N is for the Nihilistic views that I do express
And O is for Opportunities
That P - I Pissed away
And Q is for the Questions from which I've run away
And R is for, R is for, R is for my Rage
And S is for the Sarcasm that I use from day to day
T and you are Treachery and Underhandedness
And V is for the Violent nature that I do express
And W, W, X, Y and Z - I'm very, very, very, very nasty


And so your life's been a success
And you have pleasure in excess
Don't worry it will all end soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
And so your future's looking bright
And you've reached the giddy heights
Don't worry it will soon end
It is all shallow and pretend

The crack of doom
Is coming soon
The crack of doom
Is coming soon
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

And so your life
Your life has failed
You've made the progress of a snail
Don't worry you'll get your revenge
For we're all equal in the end
The small and mighty all the same
This life a shallow, facile game
Where every empire turns to dust
And every ego will be crushed

The crack of doom
Is coming soon
The crack of doom
Is coming soon
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha

And every dream, hope and desire
Is just a flicker in the fire
And that fire it will consume
The crack of doom
Is coming soon

The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom
Doom
Is coming soon


My whole life it is misery
My whole life it is grief
The face-paint it just hides my soul
My life is a deceit

My make-up lies redundant now
Between my canvas walls
The lip rouge and the face-paint
Are no longer on call
And my photographs
They're all fading fast
The children are all adults now
And their memories did not last
Well, no one really laughed at me
Just a clown who is now dead
And my suicide, my suicide, my suicide note read:
My life it was misery
My life it was all grief
And the face-paint hides my soul
My life is a deceit

Well, the blood has darkened now
Upon my suicide note
And I lie in my paupers grave
Along with my cut throat
And my whole life it was misery
And my whole life it was grief
And the face-paint it just hides my soul
My whole life was a deceit


She worked in a brothel
From the age of 13
She never made much money
Her pimp her purse would clean
She worked in that brothel
And in that brothel she was raped
And the rapist had HIV
That's what I call a bad break

And the HIV it turned to AIDS
And the rapist, the rapist, the rapist, the rapist got away

So for her funeral she had to pay
And all her so-called friends
They all stayed away

And the HIV it turned to AIDS
And the rapist, rapist, rapist, rapist, rapist, rapist,
Rapist, rapist, rapist, rapist, rapist, rapist got away


And the band play for salvation
The Hackney army tune
And a cripple in a wheel chair
He plays the silver spoons

Well, Jesus is their saviour
They fight the good fight
The drummer who plays with them
He goes home and beats his wife

They're marching down to Soho
Wake nocturnal types
And the sinners all around them
They try to show the light

Well, Jesus is their saviour
They fight the good fight
The drummer who plays with them
He goes home and beats his wife

Junkies are withdrawing
They're crouching down in pain
And Jesus ain't the saviour
Just a barrel when they see it again

Jesus ain't their saviour
They won't fight the good fight
They'll just throw away
They'll just throw away
They'll just throw away their lives


A thousand candles burning, far as the eye can see
A hundred figures stooped to light them endlessly
The wind like the Grim-reaper, blows the flames away
Just like our lives are blown out every moment
Dead souls day

The old lady, in plot 43
The pimps and politicians all drowned now in death sea
And the mourners come with their memories
And candles in their pockets to be blown out endlessly
Dead Souls Day
Dead Souls Day

Well, the organ grinder grinds
He grinds away, and we are his monkeys
His monkeys as he plays
He grinds and grinds and grinds away
Till our own
Dead Souls Day
Dead Souls Day
Dead Souls Day
Dead Souls Day
Dead Souls Day
Dead Souls Day
Dead Souls Day


The Gigolo, the Gigolo is charging twice the price
To the priest in holy orders who lives a life of vice
He pleads for mercy, God says no
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low

The old lady's savings time do erode
She can't pay for the heating, off the heating goes
She pleads for mercy, God says no
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low

The body snatcher's got no bodies to sell
It leads him, it leads him to a life of hell
He pleads for mercy, God says no
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low

Well, the Gigolo dies at the age of 43
Of a muscle wasting disease
Pleads for mercy, God says no
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low

And the body snatcher dies at an early age
And the old lady's pneumonia did rage
Pleaded for mercy, God said no
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low

And the priest died of syphilis
He died in pain
He went to God, he tried to explain
He pleaded for mercy, God said no
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Swing 'em high, swing 'em low
Births, Marriages And Deaths


The boatman sits on his boat by the river
Try as he might, he cannot forgive her
As he watches the corpse turning blue
He laughs
The boatman he sits on his boat by the river
Another grey corpse he pulls out before dinner
Another sad life, another sad time
And he laughs
The boatman he sits on his boat by the river
No name and address when he does deliver
The old ones, the worst ones, they tried and they failed
He laughs
And the odor and stench,
They once made him retch
Well now he just sees them as mortal flesh
And he laughs
Yes he laughs
Yes he laughs
Yes he laughs
Yes he laughs
Yes he laughs


Climbing up the heavenly stairs
You know where you're going when you know where
You're going to hell
Yes, you're going to hell.

You're going down a hundred eighty degrees,
You can see when you can see
You're going to hell
Yes, you're going to hell.

You were weak, you were easy to squeeze,
They did with you as they please,
You're going to hell
Yes, you're going to hell.

They're going to tear you limb from limb
Because of your so-called sin
You're going to hell,
Yes, you're going to hell.

They're going to tear you limb from limb
Because of your so-called sin
You're going to hell,

Yes, you're going to hell
Yes, you're going to hell

Normal the trouble
Normal the fear
Normal the distress
Normal the tears
Normal the yearning when you go away
Normal you want them to stay
And these tears that run down your face
Hide them it's a disgrace
Normal your blunting of mind
Normal your lust
And normal you're blind
And normal your crave for what you can't have
Normal you're feeling sad
And these tears that run down your face
Hide them it's a disgrace
Normal your decline and slide
Normal your loss of pride
And normal you want to scream
Normal you're a machine
And these tears that run down your face
Hide them it's a disgrace
A disgrace, a disgrace, a disgrace, a disgrace


Jimmy was just coming out of school
When the drug-dealer came
Give me some of that heroin
Some of that cocaine

Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine

Jimmy's teacher was very annoyed
He gave Jimmy the cane
He shared his syringe with a class full of boys
Now they all want the same

Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine

Jimmy's turn to die
But please don't you cry
Because Jimmy is in heaven with his drugs
And the angels all try

Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine
Heroin, heroin and cocaine


Sitting there in your cell
With your anguish and your hell
And no cure, no cure for you
When you're prison house blue
Four walls on which you stare
Nobody loves you, nobody cares
Nobody's waiting out there for you
When you're prison house blue
And as they rape your soul
As the violence does show
Prison house blues
Prison house blues
Prison house blues
Prison house blues
Prison house blues
Prison house blues
Prison house blues
Blues
Jacky, she's a fake whore,
She'll obstruct you on your way.
And she'll hit you and she'll beat you,
Every day.
And, Jacky, she's a fake whore,
And she's seen better days.
She will kick you down the stairway,
Every day.
And, Jacky she's a fake whore,
And it's her fifth fix today.
All the men who have abused her,
Well she spits on them today.
And, Jacky she's a fake whore,
And she has gone away.
Someone knifed her in the alley,
Yesterday.
Yesterday.
Yesterday.
Yesterday.
Yesterday.


Despite imagination being burnt and being blind
Despite your cries for mercy, well I smile and feel refined
Despite your allegories for love and hate and war
I will love you for reasons insecure
And despite your wish is contrary my motives are impure
My rushing to another banner to find a cure
And despite the alienation my morality's obscure
I will love you for reasons insecure
And despite the animosity, the hatred and the fear
The sacrosanct pomposity which gives me so much cheer
And despite the words of hell, that I whisper behind doors
I will love you for reasons insecure
Yes, I will love you for reasons insecure, insecure


Those autumn leaves go past my window.
Those autumn leaves of red and gold.

I see your lips those summer kisses,
Those sunburned hands I used to hold.

Since you went away the nights grow long,
And soon I'll yearn old winter's song

But I'll miss you most of all, my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall


Sitting in a death house and smiling with a leer
Happy, I should say so, hiding every fear
Asking you some questions, chance it is untrue
Twisted, corrupted and shot blue

They don't love you, Lager Lout

All of your white lies they're all turning black
Your liver's got a cancer, your heart's under attack
And your brain so much at bay, they could build a port
They filled you up with ignorance and the Daily Sport

And they don't love you, Lager Lout
They don't love you, Lager Lout
They don't love you, Lager Lout
Lager Lout
Lager Lout
Lager Lout
Lager Lout


You were seventeen, pretty in the head
Sent in some photographs, this is what they said
Open your legs
Open your legs

You wanna be a model, and this could be a start
They're only jealous when they call you a tart
Open your legs
Open your legs

There's a demand, you're the supply
Dry your tears, that's why
Open your legs
Open your legs
Open your legs
Open your legs
Open your legs
Just open your legs


Someone is saying that all of these things are nothing and all in your mind
Well you see quite clearly except when you're down and then you forget all the time
You see it clearly, you follow it nearly and understand the design
Then someone smacks you in the mouth and you might as well be blind
When you're down and out
When you're full of doubt
All you do is kick and shout
I'm amazed by the senseless and sensitive words we've got a talent to find
I'm amazed at what we will stoop to, if we think our egos can shine
When you're down and out
When you're full of doubt
All you do is kick and shout
When you're down and out
When you're full of doubt
All you do is kick and shout
Kick and shout
Kick and shout
Kick and shout
Kick and shout
Kick and shout
Kick and shout
Kick and shout
Kick and shout


Skinheads have all gone
England's bastard sons
Pissed on all those years
I guess nothing matches tears
Nothing matches
Nothing matches

You wore your Union Jack
As you knifed me in the back
Well I could feel your fears
Yes nothing matches tears
Nothing matches
Nothing matches

You're so unsure about
You're so full of doubt
As you watch the passing years

40's around the corner
Tattoo's are getting smaller
As you watch the passing years
I guess nothing matches tears
Nothing matches
Nothing matches
Nothing matches tears
Tears
Tears
Tears


People with cigarettes,
Singers with violets
Some who have no regrets
In her room

Men with no hair
Girls in their underwear
Boys who are debonair
In her room, In her room
In her room, In her room
In her room, In her room

Where are the fun times?
Where are the rum times?
Where is the sunshine
In her room

Looking for dog-ends
Picking up her friend
Looking for the end
In her room, In her room
In her room, In her room
In her room, In her room
In her room, In her room

Found her beat black and blue
With the words 'I love you'
Tattooed in rouge
In her room, In her room
In her room, In her room
In her room, In her room
In her room, In her room


And you with your insufferable power
Breaking hearts by the hour
We die with the flowers
And you, a poisonous shower
That breaks as we cower
We die with the flowers
And slaves have lost their chains
Think they've lost their pain
Nothing is nothing
What more can I say
And you, who surveil from your tower
With your limitless power
We die with the flowers
And you, so faithless and dour
Our youth deflowered
We die with the flowers
And slaves have lost their chains
Think they've lost their pain
Nothing is nothing
What more can I say
And you, you who devour
Well, you had your power
We die with the flowers
We die with the flowers
We die with the flowers
We die with the flowers


Strike some medals don't make a fuss
Forget about the two of us
We're off to war
Doesn't matter if you agree
You're hear to kill, you see
We're off to war
Off you go and do your best
Stick some bayonets in some chests
We're off to war
And after your life's been consumed
Then peace will be resumed
We're off to war
Did you ever wonder why
Nothing changes if you die
We're off to war
And if you state a point of view
They will simply run you through
We're off to war, We're off to war
We're off to war, We're off to war


I took him some flowers
Passed pillars and towers
The statue defaced and unclean
And though he might lie there
I don't think that you care
And your graffiti confirms the scene
His birthday arrived
You just can't stand quiet
Your lack of respect is obscene
Your marker pen ready
Your ego unsteady
Your victim of sad reflected dream
And so you disgrace him
And you deface him
And yet you don't know what I mean
You with your decadence
Your mindless arrogance
Your lack of respect is obscene
Your lack of respect is obscene
Your lack of respect is obscene


You climbed the mountain tops until the pennies dropped
In your world
You climbed the mountain tops until the pennies dropped
In your world
In your world
In your world

You'll walk a thousand miles if it's in the right style
For your world
You'll walk a thousand miles if it's in the right style
For your world
For your world
For your world

Well, it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem to show
It's just when I look at you
I know

It's anger, fear and fake veneer
In your world
It's all anger, fear and fake veneer
In your world
In your world
In your world
In your world
In your world


Desire and despair and decadence
All wrapped up in providence
Your misery which you let bleed
Your sense of sentiment
You climb the stairs and have no cares
Except tomorrow and except despair
I wish that I had half your strength
Your sense of sentiment
I got smacked by the idol worship
Well, I hope that it was worth it
Exotic, quixotic and so neurotic
Your sense of sentiment
And if it makes no sense at all
Then you will give it your all
I love you, I need you
I'll die and bleed for
Your sense of sentiment
Yes, I love you, I need you
I'll die and bleed for
Your sense of sentiment


Vilification of what you said
Now all the roses are almost dead
Vilification of times gone by
Well, it's funny how we sometimes cry

One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up

Well, complications along the way
Make our bodies wanna stray
Hallelujah is on our side
Well, it's funny how we sometimes cry

One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up

Well, I don't know if it's the beginning
Or if it is the end
I don't know if you're my enemy
Or if you are my friend
I don't know if this is good,
I don't know if this is bad
I don't know if you're happy
Or if you're sad

One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up

One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up


Vomit stains mixed with blood
Someone somewhere is in love
Repulsion, repulsion
Epileptic's foaming mouth
Mental sickness burns you out
Repulsion, repulsion
Brand new shiny disease
Which eats you up, a corpse to leave
Repulsion, repulsion
Crinkled peach, mildew and mold
No love for the very old
Just repulsion, repulsion
Maggots wading with the flames
Two engulf your name
Repulsion, repulsion
Repulsion, repulsion
Repulsion


Valium glances beneath plastic flowers
Heathens and sinners and men of the hour
In massage parlours on bended knees
You always wanted to please
In Sodsville
In Sodsville
Fishnets, a mini and a barrel of smack
Spend half your life on your back
Got no money, don't get no honey
Buying or selling
Yes, why are we dwelling
In Sodsville
In Sodsville
Now's the time and you want out
So many addictions to sort out
Choose your exit and go in peace
Don't look back and never speak
Sodsville
In Sodsville
In Sodsville
In Sodsville


She sits in the sunlight each morning
And waits for her memory to fade
If she tells you she's got a messiah
It's one that she's already made
She's no longer taking shortcuts
In her village of Rome
And nobody's home
By the time that the summer is over
She's nowhere to be seen
She smiles and looks slightly frightened
As you walk past she wants to cry
The daffodils bloom in the garden
Her head is buttered and fried
On a good day the great was seen clearly
On a bad she's hardly aware
And waits for the reaper to bear
Her doormat is left propped up
Since Wednesday when they came to clean
Her apartment has been re-vacated
Perhaps she is now in a home
Or perhaps she is just bone
Or perhaps she is just bone
Or perhaps she is just bone
Just bone
Just bone
Just bone
Just bone


I look into your eyes
You look up in surprise
Sitting on the Circle line
As you get up to leave
They take you by the sleeve
Sitting on the Circle line
They say you cannot change
Your journey's been arranged
Sitting on the Circle line
And you're not free to leave
Just free to be deceived
Sitting on the Circle line
See the whores and the virgins
The tea-totallers drinking gin
See the prisoners of faith
And make no mistake
We're sitting on the circle line
We're sitting on the circle line


Haunting me
All you ever did was haunting me
With a shadow of a smile for a while
Haunting me
From the cradle to senility
Well, I shouldn't lie, should I
Sentimental violation of another child
Haunting me
Using and abusing me
Well, I would cry, I would cry
Haunting me
All you ever did was handle me
Do I testify your trials of denial?
Sentimental violation of another child
You're my very special friend
Why are you so wild?
Haunting me, Haunting me
Haunting me, Haunting me
Haunting me, Haunting me
Haunting me, Haunting me


This one's a dodo
This one's a flop
This one's a moron
And I'm fit to drop
Cross-fire chatter
Caught in the slums
She's off to her Chelsea Hotel

Her friend was out...
Another one died
She felt depressed
She almost cried
And then she remembered
She'd left her hat
Back in the Chelsea Hotel

No more Lily Marlene
Boys in the back-room falling in love again
She was an angel
Caught in crossfire
Out of Germany
Before it expired

History is written
The blue angel's gone
And this could be her saddest song
And history is written
The blue angel's gone
This could be her saddest song
Song
Song
Song


Train running down the track
Blood pouring down my back
Here we go, beat me blue and black
This knife it bears its scars
And this heart it beats too hard
And these memories I will discard
Well, it must have been an angel
And it must have been the spring
And, it must have meant everything
I piss upon the floor
My blood runs down the door
The ambulance just made another score
Well, these wounds will congeal
And this heart will heal
So stitch me up, I will not squeal
Must have been an angel
And it must have been the spring
And, it must have meant everything
Stitch me up, stitch me up, stitch me up
I will not squeal
So, stitch me up, stitch me up, stitch me up
I will not squeal


I won't work in your factory
I won't work on your land
And I won't obey you any more than I can
Your politics disgusting
Your system makes me retch
The poor are getting poorer
The weak ones more repressed

I won't crawl up your orifice
My seed will not be spent
You can gouge my eyes out
I will not repent
Come on gouge my eyes out
I will not repent
Come on gouge my eyes out
I will not repent

To be perfectly frank with you
I won't give a toss
If they crucify the lot of you
On a burning cross

I wake up every morning
The first thing that I do
Is take my two fingers and stick it up at you

I won't crawl up your orifice
My seed will not be spent
You can gouge my eyes out
I will not repent
Come on gouge my eyes out
I will not repent
Come on gouge my eyes out
I will not repent

I will not repent, I will not repent, I will not repent


Violin time at the port side
And the whores say pretty words
To an old man who is dying
And his cries they do disturb
Violin time for the soldier
He curses as you squeal
And he kills you for a reason
Patriotic imbecile
Violin time, violin time, violin time, violin
Violin time for the mother
And the child she has lost
Violin time, violin time
As they nail her to the cross
Violin time, violin time, violin time, violin
Violin time, violin time, violin, violin
Violin time for the desperado
Who is crying into his cup
Violin time, violin time
As they come to lock him up
Violin time, violin time, violin time, violin
Violin time, violin time, violin, violin


The clowns are jumping in and out
They laugh, they scream, they jump and shout
The audience think they are so brave
To stand up there and misbehave
Escapism that's what we need
You are too miserable indeed
We came to be entertained
Not hear about your hate and pain
Be joyful and be happy
And most of all be crappy
Spielberg, he was right on cue
Your foreign films elitist spew
We don't need you to tell us
That life's a misery, life's a cuss
Be joyful and be happy
And most of all be crappy
Be joyful and be happy
And most of all be crappy
Be crappy, be crappy, be crappy, be crappy,
Be crappy, be crappy, be crappy, be crappy,
Be crappy, be crappy, be crappy, be crappy


I was walking down the street
With a terrible deceit
In my heart
I had lots of precious plans
To find the flames
And then depart
And all of these words
Well, they're just a deceit
To hide what within is weak
Your evil has no bounds
So ears to the floor
And hear the sound
And you were born in hell
Craving everything and that as well
And all of these words
They're just a deceit
To hide what within is weak
Is weak, is weak, is weak


Blind Willy, leads me to your door
Blind Willy, wants you more and more and more
Blind Willy vomits on your floor
Blind Willy says you're the one that he adores
But after he's made his entrance he's quickly at your door
Blind Willy vomits on your floor
Afterwards Blind Willy's feeling rather small
After the rise comes the fall
Blind Willy vomits on your floor
Blind Willy, Blind Willy, Blind Willy,
Blind Willy, Blind Willy, Blind Willy,
Blind Willy, Blind Willy,
Blind Willy vomits on your floor
Blind Willy vomits on, Blind Willy vomits on
Blind Willy vomits on your floor
Blind Willy vomits on your, Blind Willy vomits on your,
Blind Willy vomits on your floor


In the boulevards of broken dreams
Where smiles don't mean a thing
Doctors, nurses and your cries
The flicker of your silhouette
As you smoke your last cigarette
Doctors, nurses and your cries
I saw a boy like you
Down the avenue
Slash your wrists, take some pills
Hang yourself with daffodils
Doctors, nurses and your cries
Tears running down your cheeks
Desolation of you speak
Doctors, nurses and your cries
And I saw a boy like you
Down the avenue
Doctors, nurses and your cries
Doctors, nurses and your cries
Doctors, nurses and your cries
Doctors, nurses and your cries


Just because you're sometimes stupid
Just because you're sometimes mad
Just because you play the idiot
Just because you're sometimes mad
Just because you knew you ought to
When you never ever would
Doesn't mean you'll never be good
And just because you've got a black heart
Doesn't mean you're always bad
Just because you feel decrepit
Like an old rag
Just because you knew you ought to
When you never ever would
Doesn't mean you'll never be good
And just because you're feeling angry and misunderstood
Just because your acting's awful
It's made of wood
Just because you knew you ought to
When you never ever would
Doesn't mean you'll never be good
It doesn't mean you'll never, doesn't mean you'll never
Doesn't mean you'll never be good
It doesn't mean you'll never, doesn't mean you'll never
Doesn't mean you'll never be good


Fallen hero is fighting at the Fez
Fallen hero is losing, nobody cares
And they found him dead
In the back of his car
Shot through the heart
Under cold, blue stars
Fallen hero, the hero of the past
Fallen hero, don't you know it never lasts
And they found him dead
In the back of his car
Shot through the heart
Under cold, blue stars
Fallen hero is slow, once you were fast
Those who asked you questions,
Now they never ask
Well, they found you dead
In the back of your car
Shot through the heart
Under cold, blue stars
Under cold, blue stars


God, I've been a sinner
God, I know I'm damned
I'm a homosexual hermaphrodite
And a dirty old man
God, I've been a sinner
At the Pearly Gates
St Peter slipped it in again
He always comes to late
God, I've been a sinner
And now I'm gonna die
Can I get into to heaven
If I wear a suit and tie?
God, I've been a sinner
God, I know I'm damned
I am a Pakistani
And I come from Birmingham
La-la-la-lalala lala-lala-la
La-la-la-lalala lala-lala-la
La-la-la-lalala lala-lala-la
La-la-la-lalala lala-lala-la
God, I've been a sinner
I had sex with sheep
And when I did have sex with them
Insertion it was deep
God, I've been a sinner
God, I know I'm damned
I am a Pakistani
And I come from Birmingham
La-la-la-lalala lala-lala-la
La-la-la-lalala lala-lala-la
La-la-la-lalala lala-lala-la
La-la-la-lalala lala-lala-la


The people here are happy
In heaven in the sky
And sometimes when you're suffering
Well, sometimes they do cry
In heaven, in heaven
So throw away your foolish pride
It is no good to cry
For people here are snappy
The people here are happy
In heaven, in heaven, in heaven, in heaven
Heaven


I don't know why we're singing
Nobody hears
I don't know why we're happy sometimes
While we're full of fear
Then you take us by the hand
Lead us to the promised land
I don't know where we're going
And for how many years
I don't know why it's hot outside
And so cold in here
Then you take us by the hand
Lead us to the promised land
I don't know why we're smiling
The world's full of tears
I don't know why it's hot outside
And so cold in here
Then you take us by the hand
Lead us to the promised land
Promised land


Well we think you're very brave
Break, you know the rules
Think you're individual
Even think you're cool
Well you know, you're gonna anger 'em
All our customers agree,
You see, we're dying to book you, swear solemnly
You're too weird
You're too weird
You're too weird
We need to make a thousand pounds
Just to keep still with the bank
My manager will you kill
You're rather camp as well
Although my partner's gay
Our customers might stay away
You're too weird
You're too weird
You're too weird
And we're looking for R&B bands
Who all sound the same
Country, skiffle, Bluegrass
If they play the game
But you're weird
You're too weird
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird,
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird,
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird, You're too weird,
You're too weird,


Pick her up around a quarter to six
And don't forget that you love her
Take her out half an hour or so
And then you can drop her
Way on down, down, way on down
Children waiting with your wife
And the good fairy
You'll be home
For this is your life
And the cat and canary
Way on down, down, way on down
Way on down, down, way on down
She's a bad girl
Well, she knows
But she feeds her addiction
And you're a good man
Except when you're with her
Well, she lives with the contradiction
Way on down, down, way on down
Way on down, down, way on down
Yes, way on down, down, way on do


The sweetest word I ever knew
Shooting into the avenues of our hearts
Our hearts
The sweetest word I ever knew
Shooting into sky of blue and our hearts
Our hearts
Why do they come here
Why are they wise
Why do they come here
What a surprise to our hearts
Our hearts
The sweetest word I ever knew
Shooting into a sky of blue and our hearts
Our hearts
The sweetest word I ever knew
Shooting through the avenues of our hearts
Our hearts, Our hearts
Our hearts, Our hearts


We're in love with our emotions
And the sadness they bring
We're in love with hunger, hatred
And with our suffering
We could be honest
Or we could be true
Or we could be blue
We're in love with the moonbeams
That flicker
We're in love with our dreams
We're in love with hunger and hatred
And with our suffering
We could be honest
Or we could think
Or we could drown in the drink
We're in love with our imagination
We're in love with our spring
We're in love with hunger and hatred
And with our suffering
And with our suffering
And with our suffering
And with our suffering


Do you ever get a feeling
You should be watching Ealing
The heroes of our youth are all there
George and Bill, Alec and Will
All so religiously square
Well, I'm sick of blue denim
American venom
But sadly you really don't care
Somebody suffers
Somebody dies
Somebody gets old and cries
If there's a coup
It's over by two
We're home for tea by five
Well, I'm sick of blue denim
American venom
Sadly you really don't care
Well there's waltzes
And there's marches
And there's feeling so sad
And there's Margaret
And Alister playing the cad
Well, I'm sick of blue denim
And American venom
But Sadly you really don't care
Yes, I'm sick of blue denim
American venom
Sadly you really don't care
You don't care
You don't care
You don't care


When they pulled me from the wreckage
I asked three things to be explained
Is it raining, is it pouring?
And will I feel much pain?

Everyone was so nice to me
I knew there must be a punchline
Everyone was so nice to me
I knew there must be a punchline

It went, thank you, it went, thank you
Your pension will be in the post
It went, thank you, it went, thank you
You can trust in the Holy Ghost

Didn't know where I was going to die
Didn't know where I'd be
I didn't know how I was gonna get there
And whether it was Rin-Tin-Tin

Well, everyone was so nice to me
I knew there must be a punchline
Well, everyone was so nice to me
I knew there must be a punchline

Thank you, thank you
Your pension will be in the post
Thank you, thank you
You can trust in the Holy Ghost

You can trust in the Holy Ghost
You can trust in the Holy Ghost


There was a rich man who had a lot of horses and cattle,
And poultry innumerable
And there was poor girl who had only one Lamb,
Who was eating out of her hand

Is it good to destroy all you cherish
Is it good to destroy all your dreams
Is it good to destroy everything you work for
To destroy everything

You were the rich man, having all the wonders of the world,
I was the poor girl, who owned only her love.
You took it from me, and enjoyed it and you had had a whim
Sacrifice the little thing that was mine.

Is it good to destroy everything you cherish
Is it good to destroy all your dreams
Is it good to destroy everything you work for
To destroy everything

There was a rich man who had a lot of horses and cattle,
And poultry innumerable,
And there was poor girl who had only her love.
You took it from me, and enjoyed it and you had had a whim


No one hears your teardrops as they blow in the wind
No one sees your teardrops as the candles start to dim
No one ever holds you you lose and never win
The more they will not see you the more the state you're in

Teardrops

When your on your on your deathbed they might hold your hand
While they for their holiday they make their plans
No one wants the raindrops or your withered flesh
Only want you when you're young and smart and fresh

Teardrops

No one wants to know you when you're down and out
No one wants to hear it shut their ears and shout
So your teardrops they just blow in the wind
Your teardrops falling in you're mug of tin

Are blowing in the wind


When the time comes no regret
I'll embrace my friend my love and my death
I'd like to burn the whole thing down
The human race I'd like to drown

So don't make a fuss forget about us

I'd like to gorge out Hitlers eyes
So mediocre and full of lies
Or cut up John the baptists head
For the good who are now dead

Beat up Nietzsche's Superman
Slaughter now the holy lamb
Through clenched teeth hear me hiss
Slash your wrist
Capitalist

So don't make a fuss forget about us

Well mediocre and full of shit
Jesus on you let me spit
Well the revolutions starting now
Mother Mary your'e a cow

So when you see me smile and laugh
Believe me it's just a mask
Because I see through all the shit
Let me your throat slit

So now I'm queen upon my throne
You cannot win victory shown
Morality cannot me stain
I triumph every drop of rain

Your evil can't tarnish me
With your cheap morality
I'll rise above it I'll be queen
Your nightmare is my peaceful dream

I'll rise above it soar up high
Into the blue and azure sky

Don't make a fuss forget about us


The whole thing is a question mark
As you walk in the rain
You feel the drugs and alcohol pumping in your veins
It's a question mark no reason why
When I think about it I wan't to cry
The rain comes down
The whole thing is just pain
Alienation eats me consuming my brain
Tears in the rain
The whole thing is a question mark
Feel alone and lost
I feel like a thief with Jesus on the cross
The whole thing is a question mark do I wonder why
The echos that come back all of them are lies
Corruption and evil leaves me feeling sad
Tears are falling down my face I'm going mad
Tears in the rain


With high heels and stockings on
Lip rouge carefully applied
With eye shadow, her low cut dress
She will make you cry
The drugs are pumping through her veins
Her eyes are like two flames
They'll be put out fairly soon
The story is the same

Love for Sale

The rain's like diamonds
On wind screens
Her legs are like a dream
And when she kneels she'll make you feel
Like you have got to scream
The cold is blowing down the street
The click of high heel shoes
Her fresh young face is on the street
The drugs she will abuse

Love for Sale

If looks could kill you know she will
The stars shine and she's doomed
She shake her hips she'll shake her tits
As you she unzips
Down and down and down she'll go
Addictions grip her soul
She's heading for an early shower
Self destruction is her goal

Love for Sale

And when she's on that marble slab
Hope someone's left to cry
She had it all and pissed it all away
And then she died

Love for Sale
Young love for Sale.


Bitter overbearing cruel
Making each of us it's fool
Ready to us devour
Every minuite every hour
With evil relish it will thrust
Often turning us to dust
How often depression does drive
It's victims on to suicide
Depression oh most evil guide
On your corpse it takes pride
A hungry beast it will devour
You in your desperation hour
And never will it let us go
All opportunity will show
Always there to you befriend
Our faithful mistress till the end
If you want the truth to know
Never will she let us go
Indefatigable it's course
As over you it applies force
Depression hovers over us
How visciously she does thrust
She beats us down once again
Faithful mistress to the end


It's sin that is winning
Conmen and stuff
Let's use and abuse
Till we've had enough

Fuck God up in heaven
He isn't all there
He's just an impostor
Behind beard and hair

Jesus is someone
Who just makes me cross
He died for our sins
I don't give a toss

I'll go out whoring
I just don't care
For God up in heaven
He isn't all there

While Kierkegaard asks
These questions of you
I'll be on my 14th
Night on the screw

I'm up to my armpits
Pussy galore
Taking another
Fresh young whore

Do you think I care, care a bit
Your'e just a bunch of stupid gits
The morning I wake up hangover stings
And into the canal I could myself fling

But when I see all those pious gits
I'd like to kill them or at least them to hit
So I'll write some more shit
At least I might pass some to time for a bit...


Give me the money do what you like
But watch my pimp he's got a switch-blade knife
You know my pimp he beats me good
He beats me with a pole of wood

He's so bad it makes me glad

You know my pimp he's so mean
His whispers in my ear are so obscene
He's so dirty when he fucks
I know then that I'm in luck

He's so bad

He likes to sell me thinks it's fun
He slaps me hard when his jobs done
He takes my money with a lear
As he pokes me with his spear

I guess that I'm some kind of fool
But I just love to be his tool
The way that he abuses me
The bastards mean dirty and lazy

You know he loves me loves me good
When he gives me gives me wood
I'm so open wide I don't care If I die
He fills me with the best drugs

I want him, so much me to love
It's his love I do crave for him I'll be deprave


I don't see what I see
This whole world life's a dream
Good and bad happy and sad
And I know that I am mad

All alone left to moan
Like a dog without a bone

Alienation eating me
Till with god I am free
Petty morals of the state
So quite soon I shall break

Bourgeois morals keep me down
Melancholy I will drown
God almighty you are king
Pissing hailstones on me fling

Fucked marooned on a beach
For your mercy I do seek
But you know my mind is fucked
All logic is from me sucked

Like a bum beat in the ring
Praise to you still I sing
But I know each breath
If in truth is in excess

All I wrote was just a code
Insanity I upload

Father father beat me up
Whores all fuck me with their lust
None of it makes any sense
Intellectually we are dense


Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd, and twat

I fucked your mom

And I wanna suck my dad
And my mommy too
Oh, is this thing on?


It's dirty down in the gutter
With the perverts and the nutters
And you just do everything
Lower and lower it you brings

The lowest things normal are
You're giving blow jobs in their cars
You take it all you smile and laugh
As they stick it up your arse

And sometimes you're having fun
The drugs and sex make you come
It's nice to sink so low
The perversion grows and grows

But then the hang over it strikes
Your fucked and tired an empty life
But with the drugs back in your veins
You start it all up again

Your pimp he smiles and he knows
And down and down you do go
When your down there's no way out
Though sometimes you do scream and shout

Open wide and come again
Now the devil is your friend
Your pimp he knocks you about
You love it as you scream and shout

Down and out you're down and out


Hypocrites all around you, knocking everyone
Contradictions everywhere, you should have stayed dumb
Marvel at the stupid so strong is their voice
Either or either or dazzling the choice

Half the time you're bleeding, half the time you laugh
Half the time it's all in front, half the time it's past
Existential contradiction, the flag is at half mast
It's time for your execution, the populous all laugh

So you are a victim, or are you not
Or perhaps you're neither, hear the raindrops
Did boredom drive you onwards, anxiety to come
Will you end in despair, either or does come

Exploiting and corrupting, what now does that mean?
Wake up from this brothel, it is a bad dream
Is god or the devil, the ultimate choice?
I can hear you singing, with an angels voice

Anxiety is creeping, god's forgotten them
Until they know when
Anxious they are waiting, evil in their voice
Either or either or, they don't have a choice


I'm sailor I'm full of fun
I'm bulging now and full of cum
I need a whore I need her now
She could be innocent or a cow

I need her now take me to a room
Her eyes are empty and full of doom
The room is small a rotten smell
The carpets threadbare am I in hell

She takes my money I feel greed
The needle marks I know her needs
She licks my cock it's kind of sad
As an actress I spose she's bad

She's done it all ten times before
And that's only today I'm sure
She fakes excitement she tries a moan
I stick it in and start to groan

Now in a rubber my spunk I shunt
She wants me quickly to dump
Now she's searching for a tip
I'm feeling empty I'm feeling shit

I wouldn't mind a face to punch
I'll have a kebab for my lunch
But I'm a sailor how I'll lie
About the whores I made them cry

Eh eh!


Innocence just a dream
Once I was so clean
Virtuous and pure
Boys queuing at my door

So now I look back
Back before their lust attack
Now I sometimes sigh
Watching as time goes by

Once I had a dream
That it meant something

It was fun to be abused
It was fun being used
I love to be slapped around
I loved going down

Still I had a dream
That it meant something

Buy now as they stick it in
I get bored of so much sin
I dream to be a little girl
Without a care in the world


A billion diamonds glisten in the sea
Each of those diamonds is dirt cheap
Each one is free
You know money cheapens each and everything
I want to turn out all the lights and to you sing

Nothing is sin

I just a dreamer who they've dragged to earth
Just an angel they've covered in dirt
It doesn't matter if I laugh or if I cry
Scream obscenities or sing lullabies

Nothing is sin

It doesn't matter or mean a thing
You'll rape my soul even in your dreams
God he haunts each moment still
I'm innocent if him you could kill


From boredom the garment of evil is worn
From boredom each evil thought is born
I would be happy but need a thrill
Give me a whore give me a pill

Give me a war which to fight
Give me bank to rob tonight
From boredom evil thoughts are formed
From boredom comes the devils spawn

Give me a witch that I can burn
Give me a God that I can spurn
Give me a country to whom I'll kneel
Give me an enemy the pig will squeal

From boredom evil it does come
I'll rape I'll rob I'll fuck your son
Give me someone to abuse
Give me a substance I can use

Give me a chance to poison youth
It's because I'm bored and that's the truth
So boredom is the source of all evil within
Our need for new sensations leading us to sin

Give me a whore in the street
She'll be a doormat at my feet
Give me a side give me a team
At the opposition abuse I'll scream


The cancers got it's grip upon you
More evil than a grinning clown
More evil than the harbour in Shanghai
In which the suicides do drown

Blood Alley you won't be tripping down it
In opium dreams you'll be damned
In blood alley with another set of dreamers
Vertinsky sings and no one gives a damn

And we can only watch as time passes
See the young ones getting old
The drinkers and the rebels and the junkies
So now your warm heart is going cold

We're drunk, the cold bites like a bulldog
At the market they're singing bags of bones
The sausages are sizzling with the onions
In your grave you're just skin and bones

The strange girl who sings like Marlene Dietrich
Shall we murder those young groupie girls?
The trannies twitch and dream of young men
The street girls dream of diamonds and pearls

The harmonium is no longer wheezing
The celeste is rusting in the rain
Anna who's son died at the market
And left her bereft and in pain

Another alchy's kidneys have malfunctioned
In the gutter now he does lie
Your penny whistle blows down this lonely street
On Blood Alley I say goodbye


She is there, she is there in the larder,
Preserved for all time for his ardour,
She's been dead sixteen months in September,
Since they burned her coffin to an ember.


Well, he loved her too much to let her die with the flames
Now he comes home each eve and she's always the same,

Well not quite, the flesh is decaying,
And the smell stops friends from staying,
He kissed her goodbye, she let out a cry
Now the body remains as she died.

And, he loved her too much to let her die with the flames,
He comes home each evening and she's always the same,

He got a book on embalming and he found it simply quite charming,
She is there, she is there in the larder, preserved for all time for his ardour
She is there, she is there in the larder


Your legs ache, your back aches, you dribble down your chin.
Your steps are like mountains and so you must begin,
To gasp and stagger, and dribble down your chin,
You dribble, you dribble, you dribble down your chin.
The faces, look at them, they all avert their eyes,
Can't stomach, can't stomach, can't stomach your demise.
You gasp and you stagger, and dribble down your chin,
You dribble, you dribble, you dribble down your chin.

The faces, look at them, they all look away,
Can't stomach, can't stomach, can't stomach your decay.
You gasp and you stagger, you dribble down your chin,
You dribble, you dribble, you dribble down your chin,
Yeah.

And every time I see you, it gets (it gets repeats 32 times)
It gets a little worse.

As they lead you, as they lead you (lead ya repeats 10 times)
Lead you to your hearse,

You dribble, you dribble you dribble down your chin (repeats 3 times).
You dribble dribble down your chin.


In Polynesia the weather is fine,
The Frenchies experiment all of the time,
We are all full of shit, we know this is true,
But when you ain't got a bumhole, you feel blue.

Bumhole, bumhole, give us a bumhole do.

The Rainbow Warrior, they blew it up,
'Cause it tried to kick up a terrible fuss,
Nuclear testing is all very well,
When you ain't got a bumhole, life can be hell.

Bumhole, bumhole, give us a bumhole do.

Well we don't care about the size,
We don't care about the shape
But when you haven't got one,
It feels like a mistake.

Bumhole, bumhole, give us a bumhole do.
Give us a bumhole do...


Darkness the master, darkness the king,
Open your heart, only darkness it brings,
Only darkness, darkness.
You're a slave, a servant to this thing,
You're only messiah, the only thing,
Only darkness, only darkness.

Give them a penny, they will take a pound,
That's the only justice there is to be found in this darkness
Darkness.

Well England is fine, it's on the TV,
It makes you feel sick when you tell it to me,
Only darkness, only darkness.

In the bars of Marseilles, down the Old Kent road,
You might as well face it, it's hard and it's cold in the darkness, in the darkness.
Well, give them a penny, they will take a pound,
That's the only justice there is to be found in this darkness

Darkness (repeats 28 times)


Beat me till I'm black, beat me till I'm blue,
I will, I will love you.
Beat me till I cry, beat me till I die,
I will love you.
And burn my house to the ground,
I will not make a sound.
Beat me till I bleed, beat me, yes indeed,
I will love you.
Beat me till I cry, beat me till I die,
I will love you.
And burn my house to the ground,
I will not make a sound.
So beat me till I'm black, and beat me till I'm blue,
I will, I will love you.
Beat me till I'm black and beat me till I'm blue,
I will love you, yes, I will love you.


I've drunk whiskey, I've drunk gin, to allay, to allay my sins.
I've been nasty, I've been unkind, I'm a swine, I'm a swine, I'm a swine.

I've drunk Cointreau and Cognac
So I could stab you, stab you in the back.
I've drunk a lake of wine, I'm a swine, I'm a swine, I'm a swine.

And I've drunk a barrel of beer to allay, to allay, to allay my fear,
I stuck my finger up your behind, I'm a swine, I'm a swine, I'm a swine.

I'm a swine (X14)


You are my whore, you are the one I adore,
You are the one that my twisted heart adores,
Like a dog I will gnaw, like a dog I will paw,
You're the one that my twisted heart adores.

You are my whore, even now, old and poor,
You are the one that my twisted heart adores.
You are my whore, like a dog I will gnaw,
You're the one that my twisted heart adores.

You're the one that my twisted heart adores


He isn't deceiving, that's twenty this evening,
He's starting to feel rather sick.
The cubicle door, well it opens again,
He never quite gets used to it.

And the drugs in his veins, they don't ease the pain,

He started at sixteen and he is nineteen now,
His mother don't understand how.
He's got a disease, and he's not very pleased.
His life's almost over now.

And his funeral was a shame,
Because none of them came.

He's got a disease, he's not very pleased, his life's almost over now.
Yes he's got a disease and he's not very pleased cause his life almost over now.


God holds your hand then, and she is so strong,
She's got a hand brake that lasts so long,
And God how she loves you when you feel blue.
Crushed, you're so crushed, you don't know what to do.

This world is a ghetto where money is the dream,
And you've pawned your last coat, with nothing to redeem.

She broke your heart then, with one broken stare,
Left you the wreckage on which to stare.
You better realize something, they push you when they can,
God he don't say nothing, he just carries the can.

This world's a ghetto where money is the dream,
And you've pawned your last coat with nothing to redeem.


Well these gypsies, they are singing in the market in the square,
And these gypsies they are singing to a world that doesn't care.
These gypsies take you down, these gypsies see the truth,
These gypsies, they don't care about your beauty or your youth.

Well these gypsies, they are singing as you drink your poisoned wine,
These gypsies, they are singing as you are running out of time,
And these gypsies take you down and these gypsies see the truth
And these gypsies don't care about your beauty or your youth.

These gypsies, they are dying but their song goes on the same,
These gypsies, they are dying from your hate and pain.
These gypsies take you down, these gypsies see the truth,
These gypsies, they don't care about your beauty or your youth.
These gypsies (X4)
These gypsies, they don't care about your beauty or your youth.


On the dockside, of the portside, that's where they go.
To shoot their load, shoot their load.

She's got big tits, for all the gits,
And she hates them so, as they shoot their load, shoot their load.

As you whisper you're a slut, she will hate your guts.
As you shoot your load, shoot your load.

And on a bad night forty rubbers, she does throw,

Of your shot load, your shot load, load. just shoot your load. just shoot your load, just shoot your load, shoot your load. just shoot your load.


Worked forty years as a stevedore, five hungry mouths to feed,
When they grew up you wanted more,
They were pimps, pushers and thieves.

Worked forty years for a pittance of pay
And now it's his judgement day,
All those children have money so it's no paupers grave
For the pimps, pushers and thieves.

The pimps, pushers and thieves X3
Pimps pushers and thieves.

The rich can afford to be pious and pure,
The poor break their backs or deceive,
And when they grow up, well if they want more,

They are pimps, pushers and thieves.
They are pimps, pushers and thieves.


I saw the piss running down your leg,
I knew that you were not well,
I saw the vomit come out of your mouth
And I knew that you were in hell.

And I love you though you smell

I saw you down in Finsbury park,
You were down before you fell
And saw your face it was scarlet and red
And I knew that you were in hell,

And I love you though you smell

After the breakdown, society cared
But social workers can't be everywhere

And I love you though you smell
And I love you though you smell

Though you smell (X6)


Split your guts, sing the blues
And at parties never mind your Ps and Qs
And the pimps, well they all wear snakeskin shoes.

Mr. Hammond, at a clip joint,
Some recordings he wishes to anoint.
And the pimps, well they all wear snakeskin shoes.

Sitting beside the side of the road,
Bleeding to death, well watch your blood flow.

Opera singers, do their thing,
Bessie slaps them on the back as they do sing.

And the pimps, well they all wear snakeskin shoes.


They're taking you to dinner, they're taking you to tea,
It's meals on wheels forever, interminably,
You're old.

Now it takes you twenty when it used to take you five,
Every morning when you wake up it's not good to be alive,
You're old.

Half your friends are dying, half your friends are dead,
It takes you half an hour just to buy a loaf of bread,
You're old.

The Zimmer frame needs mending, the arthritis makes you sad,
Angina is Regina, the good times are all bad,
You're old. (repeat X5)


He puffs and he blows and he wears funny cloths,
He wears beads round his neck, his shirts a green check
Alcoholically, flair's
Growls like a bear. pulls on his jams
On a doll with no arms

Social reject so what do you expect

As he goes down the main road
He tells him to piss off
He'll growl and he'll curse
Though you'll offer your purse
He isn't well meant
He doesn't make sense
In the bar room says you are bent

He's a social reject so what do you expect

Only pleasure he's got
Is to dribble his snot
To snear at your fake veneer
He'll cross the street if you try to speak
As he probably smells and he's going there

Social reject so what do you expect
And your guilt is his neglect


George, George, he lost his life did George,
I always had a soft spot for the mother of my dad,
George, George, George.
He knew a good thing did George, the National Front aspired
And George was up for hire, oh George, George.
George, he worked at Ford Dagenham, did George,
He always was a Nationalist before he became a fashist
Oh George, George. George,
He died in a lot of pain, I never had the heart to tell him
That it wasn't such a shame. George, George,
I never had the heart to tell him that he didn't have a brain.


It's our little penthouse, we call it our own,
It's got lots of features, a gold plated phone
And it's all that we've got to lower the tone
At five o'clock in the morning.
It's cock up and shut up, it's right and it's wrong,
It's see you tomorrow, be weak or be strong,
It's hit or be hit, you know I don't care, it's five o'clock in the morning.
The red, white and blue, it's such a bore,
But it's better than being poor and it's better than being ignored at five o'clock in the morning.
So vomit your guts out on the floor, you know you will be a pawn even though we are the ones that you adore at five o'clock in the morning.
CHORUS all I'll ever be is your whore, be is your whore, be is your whore. all I'll ever be is your whore, it's five o'clock
In the morning yes it's five o'clock in the morning.


Well, you went to your shrink in Brighton,
He said there's nothing he could do,
You went to the hospital, they hadn't a cure for you.
Your mother wants you committed and your father, he does too,
And you live in an underpass, next to Waterloo.

Jesus, Jesus what are you going to do,
Jesus, Jesus how are you going to pull through?
La la la

You're having hallucinations, you're hearing voices too,
The nurses giving you lots of drugs, 'cause they're fucking good for you.
Yes, turn this water into wine, you'll be popular if you do,
And you live in an underpass, next to Waterloo.

Jesus, Jesus what are you going to do,
Jesus, Jesus how are you going to pull through?
La la la

They found your body and your body had turned blue,
They found it in an underpass, next to Waterloo.

Jesus, Jesus what are you going to do,
Jesus, Jesus how are you going to pull through?

I thought I'd try suicide, I thought it might be a laugh.
I stuck my head in an oven but the oven wasn't gas.

(Yodelling)

So then I thought I'll take some pills, I bought the wrong ones,
All I got was diarrhoea and it ran and it ran and it ran.

Suicide, suicide, that's the one for me,
I want to be a legend so suicides for me.

(Yodelling)


There's crap on the records, there's crap on CD,
It's got to be crap, it's an industry.
This crap makes me angry, this crap makes me sad,
Cause this crap, yes this crap, yes this crap is so bad.

Yes this crap this crap

Crap on the television, crap on TV,
It's got to be crap, it's an industry.
Well this crap is a sickness, this crap's a disease,
This crap rots our brains and brings us to our knees.


Murder is easy, murder is fun,
It's better than sex, I always come,
I like to stalk those I abuse,
I like them to struggle so I can refuse.

Murder is easy, murder is fun,
It's better than sex, I always come.
I like to go prowling on Saturday night,
I like them to struggle and put up a fight.

Murder is easy, murder is fun,
It's better than sex, because I always come,
I've murdered so many I have lost count,
The pleasure it gives me is a large amount.

Murder is easy, murder is fun,
It's better than sex because I always come,
I murdered the vicar, I murdered his son,
Murdered his dad and I murdered his mum.

And I murdered, murdered, murdered, murdered
Cats, cats, cats... as a boy,
Then I moved on to dogs, I moved on to dogs, I moved on to dogs
Dogs, dogs, dogs... now it's the McCoy...

Murder is easy, murder is fun,
It's better than sex because I always come,
Public opinion, it don't swell,
The consensus is I am unwell.

Murder is easy, murder is fun.
It's better than sex because I always come,

(Repeat)
It's better than sex because I always come I always come...


Violet said she was angry,
She said she was angry with me,
She said she was coming round my house to murder me.

She had a big knife,
She wanted to stick it in me.
I took out a baseball bat,
Now it's her that's dead, not me.

And the judge brings down his hammer,
There's a black hat on his head.
They're going to take me from here
And hang me till I'm dead.

I'm sitting here on death-row
Hoping they might pardon me,
Or they're going to take me from here
And hang me on Tuesday.

Hang me on Tuesday, they're going to hang me on Tuesday

Violet's mum, she found a note.
And the note, the note it said,
That violet was coming round my house,
And she wanted me dead.

Well this is my tragedy,
It's a tragedy for me.
They found the note on Wednesday
And they hung me on Tuesday.

So now I'm up in Heaven,
The noose is still around my neck,
That Violet Harrison was a right pain in the neck,

They hung me on Tuesday 


Conrad's mother said Conrad dear
I must go out and leave you here.
But mind now, Conrad, what I say,
Don't suck your thumbs while I'm away.

Snip! snip

That great tall tailor, he always comes
For naughty boys who suck their thumbs
And ere they wonder what he's about,
He's got his great long scissors out.

Snip snip the scissors go
And Conrad cries out oh!
Snip snip they go so fast,
And Conrad's thumbs are off at last.

Well, mama had scarcely turned her back,
When the thumbs were in, alack! alack!
The door burst open and in he ran,
That great long legged scissor man.

Snip snip the scissors go
And Conrad cries out oh!
Snip snip they go so fast,
And Conrad's thumbs are off at last.

Well, mama comes home and there Conrad stands,
And he looks quite sad as he shows his hands,
Ha! Ha! said mama, I knew he'd come,
For naughty little suck-a-thumb.

CHORUS and Conrad breathes his last.
CHORUS and Conrad bleeds to death at last.


The ancient mariner
He sees what you can't see
The ancient mariner
Is free he is free

The ancient mariner
Each murder now been named
The ancient mariner
Each vice now he's tamed

The wedding guest fears him
For what he's seen and done
Each ill wind that he sailed
But now his course is run

The ancient mariner
The demons in his head
Each one now has been slayed
Each one now is dead

The spirits in the wind sing
To him in his dreams
And God in a storm-tossed cloud
The mariner has seen
So if the demons say to you

You cannot find the truth
Then that's not true


The wind is howling
On this summer's day
The Cape of Good Hope
Blows our lives away

The sea roars
The lightning flash
Our timbers are all smashed
The waters coming for us
With one last breath
Over us it does gush

And we're going under the waves
Gasp and gag to our graves
But now as my breathing does cease
I feel only peace

And the mermaids carry me
I feel only free
Now my soul floats on the sea
And the mermaids play with me

All is calm in the waves
King Neptune does us save
So each sailor in the sea
If you hear remember me

When the storm does not cease
Your fate it will be peace
Only peace


I live under the sea
And a mermaid loves me
We play in the waves
Day after day

Then one day
A storm does come
And my mermaid has gone,
Gone away

So the sea birds cry away
And all I can do is pray in the waves
Sea serpent her does take
Left alone in heartbreak up in the waves

So I wait for her return
And my heart does burn
Found the serpent and cut his throat
And his corpse does float

In the sea she will roam
Till one day she comes home
In the waves


So the waves
Will clean the albatross's blood
The ship will sink beneath the waves
King Neptune will him love
So the mariner his tale does tell
Recounts his tale of living Hell

He tells them the tale
To them teach,
To save them suffering
To them he does preach

They hear his tale
Their senses are forlorn
Hey go home
Their senses reborn

So the curse
Of the dead men die
Yet still haunt
The mariner's eyes


My sail is full of wind
An end to all my suffering
There's land ahoy
The whores are waiting full of joy

The clap it waits behind those doors
Syphilis in every whore
10 years later I'll be mad
But I'll drink now and not be sad

Death waits for us as a friend
I'm looking forward to the end
This life's a joke so make haste
It's all in such bad taste

Well each old sailor knows his fate
The grim reaper makes a date
On the sea you wait for death
It's just your time till your ship's wrecked

We will drink fuck our whores
Time out soon we know for sure
With gonorrhoea these whores infect
But soon we'll take the sea as breath

This life's a joke so make haste
It's all in such bad taste


The mariner alone survives
Survives in living hell
Each sailor there does lose their lives
As he rings his bell

There among the rotting corpses
He is left to play
The wreak of their rotting limbs
The stench of their decay

For seven days on that death ship
The mariner does lie
Haunted by the curse of
Each dead sailor's eye

Until at last King Neptune
Mercy does him show
The albatross falls from his neck
At last the curse does go

So upon a dead man's ship
The rain comes tumbling down
So the dead men come to life
And start to move around

These dead men do not speak
Each is a living corpse
Yet the helmsman steers his ship
A steady north

King Neptune carries this ship
Dead sailors all him serve
Now the mariner repents
Each action and each word

So homeward the mariner floats
On King Neptune's sea
And when it is his time to die
King Neptune sets him free

Then he'll be amongst the waves
A mermaid will he love
Each day be like a summer's day
Stare at the skies above

So upon a dead man's ship
The rain comes tumbling down


Drifting in a calm sea
Water running over me
Ten weeks I'm becalmed
The serpent evil charm

I'm waiting for the wind to blow
For King Neptune mercy to show
Drifting in this calm
On the serpent evil charm

I'm waiting I wonder why
The seagulls above me cry
So in solitude
Solitude we will drift

Till Neptune does this curse lift
My mouth is dry
My mouth is parched
Will this day be my last

King Neptune save our souls
Or are we food for fishes shoals
We're drifting
Please give us a sign
I'm praying to the divine

In water soon we will sink
Water without a drop to drink
The sun just keeps beating down
Soon I know I shall drown

Oh Neptune please hear my plea
Save our souls master please
On the day that I do die
The wind blows strong the seagulls cry


So there amongst the rotten corpses
Penance you must bear
Smell the rotten flesh
On decay you stare

The putrid smell as you drift
On a dead sea
The curse of dead men's eyes
That cannot see

So ponder well
On this rotting flesh
Let your penance eat you up
Till vanity does rest

Those corpses will come to life
And on you seek revenge
Unless through your penance
Your vanity does end

So in total solitude
Decay you do breathe
The loneliest place on earth
On that cruel sea

And when at last
Your purgatory does end
Then with King Neptune
You will face the end

The curse of these dead men
The breaking of the spell
Well ancient mariner
You'll not go to Hell


Hear the serpents screaming
And know they will win
I see the storm clouds brewing
I feel an evil wind

And yet I keep on dreaming
Of calm waters and us free
I know the palace we are building
Will drown within the sea

And so the serpent tightens
His grip around our throat
So soon we will be gagging
How soon we will choke

And yet I can't stop dreaming
That one day we will be free
And we will live eternal
In our palace by the sea

And so the serpent strangles
So certain is our fate
Our hands are ripped apart
As our last breath we take

And yet we keep on dreaming
We dream eternally
That we are in our palace
Our palace by the sea


That ship waits for all of us
Black-lipped towards us thrusts
You'll be dead in one more day
So our souls will take away

Death maiden licks lips with lust
And towards us does thrust
Knows our souls to her belong
So for us this death song

She'll take our souls the end is nigh
She'll take our soul the pirates' prize
She'll take each one of us to Hell
The mariner rings his bell


Through the mist the death ship comes
Rancid fear through each one runs
To the death maiden sell your soul
Your repentance will unfold

For each one of your evil deeds
Suffering you will bleed
Each sailor turns to a rancid corpse
Your suffering must run its course

Unlimited will be your pain
Burning coals upon you rain
The death maiden rips out your heart
At your agony she laughs

You will a million times repent
Before your pain it will be spent
Each sin you did manifest
The death maiden will pain in you invest

In abject despair you'll merge
Then your sin it will be purged
Death waits for each of us


Water water everywhere
But not a drop to drink
So now your future like a flower
Withers and shrinks

We pay for each one of our sins
So now we face our death
Each sailor aboard this ship
Will soon take his last breath

So now you must face regret
And pay a heavy price
For each one of our sins
The worst is pride the vice

Water water everywhere
Without a drop to drink
So now in hellish punishment
You are left to think


So northwards their ship did sail
The mariner he did not fail
The bird the omen of good luck
For it they did not give a fuck

Hypocrites one and all now on call
Well when their ship it was becalmed
That's when the mariner did the harm
He shot their lucky omen down

The mariner they want him drowned
Those hypocrites want their revenge
The albatross must be avenged
The mariner their Anti-Christ

Now their hatred they do splice
The albatross around his neck
Around his neck is hung
The mariner's a scapegoat curses at him flung


So the saviour is killed
And for a while depends
The jury it will be out
From fair weather friends

No matter how barbarous
If the wind blows fair
For a murdered saviour
Nobody will care

Because each one
In selfishness does live
While their interests are fulfilled
In evil they'll forgive

So the murdered albatross
Crocodile the tears
With the wind the mariner
Has nothing to fear

But when they are becalmed
Then they seek revenge
Then their morality
It must be avenged

Then their saviour's memory
Then they do respect
And hang the albatross
Around the mariner's neck

Becalmed the albatross avenged
Albatross hangs round his neck


At Length Did Cross An Albatross


Long grey beard and piercing eye
A wedding guest am I
The mariner he tells his tale
As time it passes by
Driven by the wildest storm
Into those poles of ice
In those eyes you see
A world of greed, hatred and vice
An albatross it came to them
In that land of ice
And with that helmsman
He then saved their lives
The mariner the Anti-Christ
He shot that bird down
Though when a fair wind blew
Praise it did abound
The evil of the mariner
It so now abounds
The murder of the saviour
In pride now he does drown
His twisted sense of pride
Now murder he commits
Destruction of the saviour
Now his throat he slits


See him fly across the sky
Saving souls no reason why
He in mercy goes in peace
Each one's soul to release
Which of them wants to be saved
Takes them from a certain grave
Each of them who does repent
Up to Heaven will be sent
But while evil's still alive
All our saviours they will die
For in jealousy they live
In the righteous can't forgive
So the mariner his bow takes
And his saviour does break
He who has him saved
Now feels like a slave
So though he was sure to drown
Shoots in malice shoots him down
So the saviour from the sky
For his vanity he cries
So for vanity he dies
Shot down from the sky
The albatross he dies
The mariner's foolish pride


Now in this land of ice
We pay for every vice
Frozen in the snow
Each pleasure it goes
Each lust and desire
Frozen every fire
So we await our fate
In this frozen waste
But though the ice winds blow
Leave us in the snow
Our evil is not spent
We do not repent
So if a saviour comes
Our vice will not have run
The ice and the storm
Leaves us unreformed
So we await our fate
In the frozen waste


The storm waits to eat you and me
Don't you know that we're all guilty
As the storm-tossed water breaks
Make you pay for each mistake
The storm will eat you alive
Pray to God you will survive
But you know that if you live
God will not you forgive
Done your evil sowed your seeds
Now the harvest does you feed
Now that wind rips you apart
It will rip your evil heart
Need a saviour your luck's spent
But in fear alone repent
Once that storm it has passed
Then once more in evil bask


Drunk on rum what a bum
But the breeze fills up my sails
Cabin boys I annoy
Well they know how not to fail

Take 'em all one by one
Well a pervert must have fun
Give 'em wood it does 'em good
I know they could be my sons

You're gonna be what you will be
And it is no good to fight
I don't feel bad I don't feel sad
I fuck them it's my right

A callous sod some think I'm odd
But a man must have his fun
So I sigh to sea and sky
As my blood runs

When I die it will be hot
Destination Hell I got
Cabin boys they make me sin
I drown my guilt I am in

If you ask I feel shame
And my guilt causes pain
But though that guilt does try again
My lust does rise for pain

Then again I have my fun
And once again my evil comes
With that lash I them slash
Otherwise there'll be no cash

Then I'll be back on the deck
Fuck with me and you I'll wreck
I'm the sadist with a lash
Cabin boys their backs I slash

Cat o'nine tails oh what fun
I know how to treat the scum
But now I am down below
And submission's what they show

I too must have fun
So cabin boy your job is done

When your blood runs


Sweet breeze blows them out to sea
They do sing they feel free
In the harbour their girls do cry
In the seven seas they'll die
Children play above the cliffs
Will their fathers they miss
Church bells ringing out to sea
A mermaid dances and they feel free
These sailors addicts all
The sea each one does enthral
Each one knows one day they'll drown
Their bodies never found
But still they need they need to sail
Each one's addiction never fails
In the harbour their girls do cry
In seven seas they'll die


Tattooed we dance the tango, in a melancholy way,
Bearded ladies, muscle men, freaks entering the affray.
Crowds come in from the suburbs to observe the perverse,
Jimmy the pick-pocket he's on the loose,
Mind out and watch your purse.

Frankie the brain damaged boxer, he's only got left a year,
The local bums take him for a round and for his blood they cheer.
Prostitutes do good business, they'll gob you for a days rent,
And if it's a boy that you're after, they're over behind the tent.

Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up
Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up.

Pimps count their money, they think they've got a good job.
It's better than being a gangster, it's better than being a slob.
Pin-heads, Siamese twins, midgets
They all shock the best they can.
The gypsy fortune teller, she knows we're all damned.

Our life's a side-show attraction, we do our best to please,
Our life is a side-show attraction, death, decay and disease,

Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up
Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up

Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up
Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up, Roll Up


Things are getting hard now, getting hard to find.
Your livers piccalilli, your kidneys are unkind.
Wake up every morning, you'd lie if you felt fine,
Stick you fingers down your throat now, nihilistically inclined.

That's the Tiger Lillie line.

You're hungry for the glory, on the radio you'd mime.
The alcohol consumes you, piccalilli is your mind.
They're feasting at the table, but only scraps and crumbs you find.
You're angry and you're bitter, your hat is full of dimes

Well that's the Tiger Lillie line

You wake up every morning when the clock forgets to chime
You go to sleep each evening, with the whiskey and the wine

That's the Tiger Lillie line
That's the Tiger Lillie line
That's the Tiger Lillie line
Tiger Lillie line


I'm crucifying Jesus, banging in the nails,
And I am so happy, because old Jesus failed.
I'm crucifying Jesus, nail him to the cross,
The poor old bastard bleeds to death and I don't give a toss.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm crucifying Jesus, in my piss he bathes.
I think I am a pervert, I think I am depraved
I'm crucifying Jesus, beat him to a pulp,
I stick my organ in his mouth and on it he must gulp.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

You see that crown of thorns upon his head?
Well that was my idea.
I think I might be going to hell,
Oh dear!

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.

I'm bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang,
Banging in the nails.


And the sailors, they sing sad songs,
About the sea that eats them whole.
And the sailors they sing sad songs,
Food for fishes shoals.

And the wind it blows inland,
And the death you can smell.
Smashed on rocks and smashed on boulders,
Smashed in living hell.

And their loved ones wait for hours,
Await the fate of the cruel sea
And if loved ones don't return,
There's no security.

Just the work-house when they grow old,
To lay their weary heads,
And the sound of the sea singing
Until they are dead.

And the sea that bears its harvest
It exacts a heavy toll,
Mothers, fathers, brothers, uncles,
With no corpses to behold.

Sailing out into the darkness,
Every day of the year.
Sailing out into the darkness,
With a prayer, and with fear

And with fear,
With a prayer, and with fear.
And with fear.


1,2,3,2,2,3

Well it's grim up north
But it's grimmer than that in Slough
I'll sing you a song
If you drop a bomb on Slough

Driving about in your car.
Making another box of Mars Bars
In Slough, Slough.

Well the shift-works a dog
And your life is a slog
In Slough
Night and day you work for your pay
In Slough

24 hours you are on call
They've got you, they've got you by the balls
In Slough, in Slough, in Slough, in Slough

Drop a bomb on Slough, Drop a bomb on Slough
Drop a bomb on Slough, Drop a bomb on Slough


Searching for sunlight, there in your room.
Trolling for one light, there in the gloom
You dream of a better day, alone with the moon.

All things are nothing, there in your tomb
All things are nothing, assured is your doom.
You dream of a better day, alone with the moon.

The laughing and joking, they all end too soon
Forgotten memories, forgotten tunes
You dream of a better day, alone with the moon.

That day, it's coming soon,
Alone with the moon, Alone with the moon
Alone with the moon, Alone with the moon
Alone with the moon, Alone with the moon
Alone with the moon, Alone with the moon


On Mondays murder children, little girls and boys
I put my hands around their throats till they don't make a noise
Tuesdays torture animals, pluck off small birds wings
Watch them as they bleed to death, then they don't sing
Wednesdays I defecate on the priest's front door
If the priest he does complain, I just do it some more
Thursdays I Molatov the local orphans home
Love those little orphans, charred down to the bone

I'm terrible, terrible, shouldn't be allowed
To sing my songs of filth to a decent crowd

On Fridays sodomize tender virgin nuns
Tie them up, lear at them, and then I have my fun
Saturdays I stand and sing my sad, sad, sick, sick songs
To anyone who listen, who in the head is wrong
Sundays, Sundays, the day I love the best
Rape, murder, pillage while other people rest

I'm terrible, terrible, shouldn't be allowed
To sing my songs of filth to a decent crowd
I'm terrible, terrible, shouldn't be allowed
But when I do offend someone it makes me feel so proud


It's pissing down with rain
The dogs they all do howl
Just beneath the surface, the faces all do scowl
Selling off an empire, they sell it by the pound
The Russians in the market square

Give him 15 Deutschmarks for an old red hat
He will sell you the coat off of his back
And he's looking handsome and he's looking sad
The Russian in the market square

The Russian in the market
The Russian in the market
The Russian in the market square

He'll tell you stories about his past
He'll tell you stories if you ask
And he's looking handsome and he's looking sad
The Russians in the market square

Yes, the Russian in the market
Yes, the Russian in the market
Yes, the Russian in the market square

Yes, the Russian in the market
Yes, the Russian in the market
The Russian in the market square

Yes, the Russian in Frankfurt Square


The Nationalists, the Socialists,
The Communists, the Capitalists
They all agree you don't exist
And they all watch as you slash your wrists

Gypsy lament, Gypsy lament
Gypsy lament, Gypsy lament

They treat you like you're a disease
They all do with you as they please
They all watch as you bleed
They bleed you of your dignity

Gypsy lament, Gypsy lament
Gypsy lament, Gypsy lament

Gypsy lament, Gypsy lament
Gypsy lament, Gypsy lament


I thought I'd be happy in heaven
I thought it would be swell
I thought I'd be happy in heaven
In fact I'm as unhappy as hell

The harps, they all bore me
St. Peter's jokes are a farce
The angels look down their noses
Because I'm from a different class

St. Mathews discovered religion
He converts people every day
Whenever he gets near me
I tell him to go away

St. Christopher, I've been rude to him
I told him what he could do with his staff
I told him where he could stick it
And he didn't laugh

Only old Mary is good'un
Yeah, she's a good sort
She's generous with everyone
She's a good sport

And God, he's a miserable bastard
He's always making up rules
I'm terribly disillusioned
I think he's a silly old fool

Jesus, he plays the guitar
He sings like Joni Mitchell
I thought I'd be happy in heaven
But in fact I'm unhappy as hell


My liver chokes, my kidney's bloat
There goes another year
Heads in pain, down the drain
Face the end with fear
Heart's been broke, downward slope
Mortuary is near
Can't delay the fateful day
The mortuary is near
Yeah, the mortuary, the mortuary, the mortuary is near
Yeah, the mortuary, the mortuary, the mortuary is near

When I die I'll ask you why
And if your answers clear
Then I'll know that you didn't lie
The mortuary is near
One more drink then I'll sink
Face the end with fear
One more smoke, then I'll croak
The mortuary is near
Yeah, the mortuary, the mortuary, the mortuary is near
Yeah, debauchery, debauchery, debauchery is near
Yeah, the mortuary, the mortuary, the mortuary is near
Yeah, debauchery, debauchery, debauchery is near


Slow death to the nightingale
His voice would always fail
In tenement towers
And on rails
And all of these praising words
They all seem so absurd, so absurd

Your poverty you declare
The paint blisters on your stairs
The dampness in your bones is always there
And all of these praising words
Well, they all seem so absurd, so absurd

Ever thought that you would be
This washed up and lonely
This washed up and lonely
This lonely


My mother was a prostitute
My father was a thief
My auntie ran a brothel
It gave cheap relief
Crime, crime
Crime doesn't pay

And my sister worked in peep shows
Carrots between cheeks
My brother pimped for call girls
Fostered their deceits
Crime, crime doesn't pay
Except when the debt collector needs to be paid

My nephew was a rent boy
Dress-sense made me weep
And my niece clipped in Soho
Her lies defied belief
Crime, crime, crime doesn't pay
Except when the debt collector needs to be paid
Crime, crime, crime doesn't pay


The shit-stains on your sheets
Show you've got three more weeks
You won't grow old gracefully

The skin pulled from your cheeks
You're voice is growing weak
You won't grow old gracefully

And I remember when
You didn't pretend

I remember in St. James Park
When we both did laugh
About growing old gracefully

Were you promiscuous
I only ask because
We won't grow old gracefully

And I remember on the Thames
You knew you'd reached the end
You won't grow old gracefully


He's got to have a hobby
He's got to have a vice
It's just that his hobby
Well, it isn't very nice.

He tells you don't tell no-one
Or else you're gonna die
Scars them for a lifetime
And every night they cry

Well both of his daughters
His wife she didn't know
Ruins all their lives
But has to though

And I saw him in the court room
The tears ran from his eyes
Were they a crocodiles
I wouldn't be surprised

Now his life is over
He's out of prison though
I told him I told him
You reap what you sow


Pretty soon, it will be you judgement day
Pretty soon, you will be in decay
Pretty soon, on a marble slab you'll lie
Hope some-ones with you when you die

Pretty soon, you body will be in pain
Every muscle and sinew will burn like a flame
Pretty soon, in fear you will cry
Hope some-ones with you when you die

Pretty soon, maggots eat your flesh
Pretty soon, old and rotting where once you were fresh
Pretty soon, your flesh putrefies
Just hope some-ones with you when you die

Pretty soon


Arthur I love you
Though you've got B.O.
And you trainers are dirty
And your brains rather slow

And Arthur I love you
Though you read The Sun
And you wear a leisure suit
When you're having fun

And your not a fascist
You're just a cog
And you keep a Pit-bull
'Cause their a lovely dog

And Arthur I love you
You're no piece of slime
Just used and accused
By the ruling class swines

Lets face it Arthur
Arthur you're fucked
You never could say
That enough, that enough...
Was enough


Well, the tree it does whither
You're hands like peaches grow old
Your back bends like a willow
With nobody left now to hold

Your dreams, hopes, aspirations
Have all turned to dust
You've nobody left now to talk to
And you've no-one left now to trust

Should I mourn your decline

Should I be nice to you
Where do I draw the line
It is in to a home that awaits you
Should I mourn your final decline

No, I will drink to your decline
I will drink to your decline


Baby is just a millionaire
He's 'orrible and unkind
Baby is just a millionaire
And he will rob you blind

And he'll have you on Monday
He'll have you on Tuesday
He'll have you on Wednesday as well

Baby is just a millionaire
He's got gold taps on his bathroom suite
Baby is just a millionaire
He's 'orrible and he's neat

And he'll have you on Thursday
He'll have you on Friday
Saturday and Sunday as well

Baby is just a millionaire
Didn't Baby do well
Baby is just a millionaire
And Baby is going to Hell

Yeah, Baby is going to Hell
Baby is going to Hell


I love a little hamster up my rectum
It makes me feel so bright and so gay
What they do with their claws the way the do gnaw
It makes me orgasm every day
I love a little hamster up my rectum
I freeze up to twenty every day
They gnaw and the claw they paw and they paw
It makes me go hip hip hip hip hooray
I love a little hamster up my rectum
But they always try to get out up my arse
They try and they try and then they do die
They always pick the wrong end of the shaft
I love a little hamster up the rectum
But they always try to get out the wrong way
They try try then they do die
Always try to exit the wrong way
But now my rectum has been ruptured
And in the pet shop I no longer pay
I'm left to reminisce of my moments of bliss
When with hamsters I had my evil ways
I love a little hamster up the rectum
I love a little hamster up the arse
I love a little hamster up the anus
It always makes me laugh
I love a little hamster up the rectum
I love a little hamster up the bum
I love a little hamster up the bumhole
Now that's what I call fun fun fun fun ...


Fill my sandwich my sandwich my sandwich with snot
With bogeys and mucus and whatever you've got
Piss on my pork pie piss on my veg
Cum over my croutons and shoot sperm on my eggs
Into my soup your pimples please squeeze
Wipe your arse wipe your arse on my cheese
Into my broth your blood please

But she's grown out of reach
Her love I beseech
My vagina my vagina my vagina in the sky
My vagina my vagina my vagina in the sky

The maggots feed they feed on him
Well some they laugh and some give in
You cannot breathe the putrid air
The bastard's dead and no one cares
There are no relatives or friends
The sad condolences descend
The pauper's grave is all that's left
No one to pay their last respects
To die in filth in filth obscure
To die so dirty and so poor
Your life was right your life was wrong
The virtues and the vice all gone
His mother's heart would surely wrench
To see the poverty and stench
A social worker does discard
A box of letters and postcards
The only records of a life
That now has passed into the light
To die in filth in filth obscure
To die so dirty and so poor
Do you ever wonder that you'd be
Left all alone and lonely
The same as him on Judgement Day
Left all alone to fade away
Because you lack the social skills
And then grow old and then grow ill
To die in filth in filth obscure
To die so dirty and so poor
To die in filth in filth obscure
To die so dirty and so poor
To die in filth in filth obscure
To die so dirty and so poor
To die in filth in filth obscure
To die so dirty and so poor
To die in filth in filth obscure
To die so dirty dirty dirty
Dirty dirty dirty dirty and so poor


To make love to a motor card
Is what I want to do
Porsche or a Ferrari
But anything will do
If I make love to Morris
Does that mean I'm gay
I smear myself in engine oil
And then I'm towed away
Can I cum in your car
Well to make love to a motor car
That's what I want to do
Don't care about the colour
Black green or blue
Don't like road protestors
They wanna take my right
To make love to a motor car
Afternoon or night
Can I cum in your car
To make love to a motor car
Is all I want to do
To make love to a motor car
Is all I want to do

Walking down the street

That's when I do practise
My favourite sport

Kick that stick kick that stick
And down they go
Well you can kick a stick

Well you can kick artificial limbs
Zimmer frames as well
But kicking sticks well that's the best way
Old aged pensioners to fell
And when they're lying
Down there on the floor
You can kick 'em kick 'em kick 'em
More and more
Kick a stick kick a stick


I'm a lonesome cowboy
Out there on the plains
And sometimes my passion
My passion must drain
And then it's into a barn
Where I'll find release
A baby calf
Will suck away the heat

I know what I'll do
And a little baby calf
On me's going to chew

It'll grow and grow
And grow

A little crude

They've severed
Most of your limbs
Your brain and eyesight
Are going dim

Well they've strangled you
Till your face went blue

Pulled your nails out

A little crude

Skinheads in the doorway
Get their heads kicked in
Full of drugs and racism

A clip joint bouncer
Beats them to a pulp
And leaves them in the gutter
On their blood to gulp

That's the news
Soho's news

Gets stabbed through the heart

In the seamen's mission drinking gin
He tried so hard not to give in
The street singers are all whores
Who ruin you when you're ashore

On the portside
Of Le Havre

The mermaids for whose love you'll pay
And the fishes who you'll feed some day
Now in the bars wine holy drink
Then in the stinking gutter sink

On the portside
Of Le Havre

Now in the chapel your body lays
And the angels take your soul away
Up to heaven in the sky
When all the sailors have died

In the portside
Of Le Havre
In the portside
Of Le Havre


You play accordion
You're going blind
The world goes past
But you're out of time

And the people in your head
Are all dead

You stagger home
The alcohol brings cheer
Your weary body
And you're full of fear

And the people in your head
Are all dead

You had a mother
And a father too
Dragged up on the streets
Were you

And the people in your head
Are all dead

And so you're singing
One last sad song
The chords and melodies
All are wrong

And the people in your head
Are all dead
And the people in your head
Are all dead


When the children have been good
That is let it be understood
Good at mealtimes good at play
Good all night and all of the day

They shall have the pretty things
Merry Christmas always brings
But naughty romping girls and boys
Who tear their clothes and make a noise

Who spoil their pinafores and their frocks
They deserve no Christmas box
Such as these shall never look
At this pretty picture book

Yes such as these shall never look
At this pretty picture book


This is cruel Frederick Frederick see
A horrid wicked boy was he
He caught the flies the poor little things
And tore off all their tiny wings

He threw the kittens down the stairs
He broke all the chairs
And ah far worse than all beside
He beat his Mary till she cried
Till she cried

The trough was full a dog called Tray
Went out to drink one sultry day
Well he had scarcely wet his lip
When cruel Fred snatched up a whip
He whipped poor Tray till he was sore
And then he whipped him more and more

At this poor Tray grew very red
And he bit Fred
And he bit Fred
Till he bled
Till he bled

Well then you should have been by
To see how Fred did scream and cry
He had to go go to bed
His leg was very sore and red
The doctor came and shook his head

Well it almost makes me cry to tell
What foolish Harriet does befell
Mama and nurse went out one day
And left her all alone to play

Well on the table close at hand
A box of matches chanced to stand
Well mama and nurse had told her
That if she touched them they would scold her

Well Harriet said what a pity
'Cause when they burn they seem so pretty
They crackle so they spit and flame
Mama and papa do often do the same

So she wouldn't take their advice
She lit a match it was so nice
It crackled so it burnt so clear
Exactly like the picture here

So she jumped for joy and she ran about
And was too pleased to put it out
Well the pussy cats they saw this
They said naughty naughty naughty Miss

Oh miaow miaoh miaow miaoh
She's burning to death we told her so

Well see what a dreadful dreadful thing
The fire has caught her apron string
She burns all over everywhere
She burns her nose and her arms and her hair

Till she's got nothing left to lose
Except her little scarlet shoes
And only these only these are found
Amongst her ashes on the ground

Oh miaow miaoh miaow miaoh
She's burnt to death we told her so
Oh miaow miaoh miaow miaoh
She's burnt to death we told her so

The pussy cats they sat beside
Her steaming ashes and they cried
Oh miaow miaoh miaow miaoh
She's burnt to death we told her so
Oh miaow miaoh miaow miaoh
She's burnt to death we told her so


Well as he'd often done before
My neighbour from next door
One fine summer's day went out
To the shops to walk about

And as he found it hot poor fella
He took with him his green umbrella
When Edward noisy little wag
He came out and waved his flag

And William came in jacket trim
And brought his wooden hoop with him
And Arthur brought his toys
And joined the other bully boys
Well those silly bully boys
They lost all their toys

Well tall Agrippa lives close by
So tall he almost touched the sky
He was giant through and through
He was giant through and through

He called out in an angry tone
To leave my neighbour alone
But they didn't mind a bit
What tall Agrippa said of it

Well those silly bully boys
They lost more than their toys

Well tall Agrippa foamed with rage
Just look at him on this very page
He seizes Arthur seizes Ned
He smashes all their tiny heads

Then they don't scream and they don't call
They are corpses one and all
Three little corpses one two three
They're all as dead as can be

Well those silly bully boys
They lost more than their toys
Well those silly bully boys
Because Agrippa they annoyed
Well those silly bully boys
They lost more than their toys
Silly bully boys
Because Agrippa they annoyed


This is the man that shoots the hare
This is the coat he wears
With game bag powder horn and gun
He's going to have some fun

The hare sits in the leaves and grass
And laughs to see the green man pass

And as the sun gets very hot
And he a heavy gun has got
The lays down under a tree
And goes to sleep as you can see

The hare sneaks up hip hop
Takes the gun and then hops off

The green man wakes and sees the hare's face
With the gun shoved in his face
Well he screams and runs away
The hare chases him all day

That hare is trying all that she can
To shoot the sleepy green coat man

Help help help help help
Help help help help help ...
Fire the hare

At last he stumbles at a well
Arse over tit and in he fell
The hare takes aim and hark
Bang goes the gun and hits the mark
Bang bang bang bang

The hare's
The green man's wife
Was drinking her coffee
From her coffee cup
The hare shot cup and saucer through
And then the hare shot her too

Help help help help help
Help help help help help ...
Fire the hare

Well the hare's own child the little hare
Lived by the cottage there
And as she stood upon her toes
The hare shot her through the nose

She died with nose in hand
And she didn't understand
And then the hare put the gun to her head
And bang went the gun and she too was
Dead dead dead dead

Deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead
Deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead
Dead dead dead dead
Help fire the hare


Augustus was a chubby lad
Great fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had
He always did as he was told
And he never let his soup get cold

So everybody saw they saw with joy
The hale and hearty healthy boy
But then one day one sad fateful day
He cried out take that nasty soup away

The second day comes the picture shows
How weak and thin Augustus grows
But when the soup is put on the table
He cries out loud as he is able

The third day comes oh what a sin
Augustus grows so pale and thin
Yet though he grows so weak and ill
He cries out cries out cries out still

Take that nasty soup away
I don't want any soup today

The fourth day comes the fourth day comes
And he scarcely weighs a sugar plum
He's like a little bit of thread
And on the fifth day the fifth day the fifth day
He was dead


Let's see if Philip can
Be a little gentleman
Let's see if Philip's able
To sit at the table

Mama bades Phil behave
And papa he looks very grave
But fidgety Phil he won't sit still
He wriggles and he giggles

Yeah fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil

Well I declare
He rocks backwards and forwards on his chair
Just like it was a rocking horse
Mama's getting very cross

See the naughty, restless child
Growing strim and running wild
Till he falls over quite
Then he screams with all his might

Yeah fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil

Then to make matters worse again
He grabs the tablecloth and then
Down upon the ground he falls
With knives plates forks spoons and all

Mama pulls such a face
At Philip's sad disgrace
And papa pulls such a frown
As Philip goes tumbling down

Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil

Where is Philip where is he
Oh there he is and he bleeds
There's a bloodstained tablecloth lying on him
Knives and forks they're all stuck in him

There's a knife and there's a fork
Oh Philip this is cruel work
What a terrible to-do
Philip bleeds to death and turns blue

Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil
Fidgety fidgety fidgety Phil


As he trudged along to school
It was always Johnny's rule
To be looking at the sky
And the clouds that floated by

Just before him there did lay
In his in his in his way
Johnny never thought about
So that everyone cried out

Well look at Johnny Johnny there
Little Johnny Johnny Head-In-Air

Running in Johnny's way
Came a little dog one day
Johnny's eyes were still astray
In the sky every day

And he never heard them cry
Johnny mind the dog is nigh
Down they fell with such a thump
Johnny and dog in a lump

Once with head as high as ever
Johnny walked beside the river
Johnny watched the swallows trying
Which was the cleverest at flying

Oh what fun oh what fun
Johnny watched the bright round sun
Going in and coming out
That was all he thought about

So he strode on only think
To the river's river's very brink
Where the bank was high and steep
And the water water very deep

And the fishes in a row
Stared to see him coming coming so
One more step oh sad to tell
Headlong in Johnny fell

Here are the fishes in dismay
Wagged their tails and ran away
Here lay Johnny on his face
With his little red writing case

And the fishes one two three
Came back again you see
Up they came a moment after
To see Johnny in the here and after

Each popped up his little head
To tease poor Johnny who was dead
Yeah each popped up his little head
To tease poor Johnny who was dead


When the rain comes tumbling down
In the country and the town
All the good little girls and boys
Stay indoors and mind their toys

Robert says no when it pours
It's better out out of doors
Well rain it did and in a minute
Rob Rob was in it

Flying Robert
Flying Robert

Well see the wind how it whistles
Through the flowers and the thistles
See the silly fella
Underneath his green umbrella

Well it has caught caught that umbrella
So up he goes the silly fella
Up he goes into the skies
No one hears his screams and cries

Flying Robert
Flying Robert

See how the rude wind bore him
And it blew his hat before him
Well he's reached such a height
He is nearly out of sight

Where he where he fell
No one yet can tell
But one thing one thing is plain
He was never seen again

Flying Robert
Flying Robert ...


Just look at him there he stands
With his nasty hair and hands
Anything to me is sweeter
Than Shockheaded Peter

See his nails are never cut
They're as grim as black as soot
Anything to me is sweeter
Than Shockheaded Peter

And this sloven I declare
Has never once combed his hair
Yes this sloven I declare
Has never once combed his hair

So anything to me is sweeter
Than Shockheaded Peter
Anything to me is sweeter
Than Shockheaded Peter ...

Shockheaded Peter ...


He's been around the world and much of it was queer
He got a nasty little rash from a brothel in Tangiers.
A knife it missed his artery in a harem in Algiers
And from a whore in Rotterdam he got Gonorrhoea.

Now he works the fairground, looks back on his career
And anyone who's interested he shows his souvenirs.

He lost a finger and an arm to a grenadier
He lost an eye in Africa to a bushman's spear.
He's been in wicked storms on all the seven seas
He's had scurvy and the plague and tropical disease.

Now he works the fairground, looks back on his career
And anyone who's interested he shows his souvenirs.


We sail in a ship and the timbers are weak
Through the storm clouds the rainbows the rainbows we seek

We sail for horizons that one day will end
To sleep with the fishes on that we depend

The wind when it howls we shiver with fear
In our bowels we do know we'll face no new year

We sail for horizons that one day will end
To sleep with the fishes on that we depend

The sea rips us open like a vice cracks a nut
Like a bum is cut down by a left upper cut

We sail for horizons that one day will end
To sleep with the fishes on that we depend


Albino dwarfs & dancing bears & midgets with full body hair
A man who has a fishes tail, a girl whose body is a snail
A man whose head is a bird, a girl who shits bricks as turds
Siamese twins joined at the head, a girl who though alive is dead
A man who bleeds through hands and eyes, a girl who has a donkeys thighs

This Freakshow is the best in town this Freakshow is the worst around.

A man who has no head or arms, a girl a dog sexually charms
They're animal eroticists, the sailors leer at them all pissed
A fire eater burns his throat, a jealous lover at him gloats
A contortionist tells a joke while a gorilla him does poke
A girl who bites off chickens heads, they run around till they are dead

This Freakshow is the best in town this Freakshow is the worst around.


We could have danced all night
Into the morning light
In that cheap penny arcade

We could have danced all night
Into the morning light
In that cheap penny arcade

But fate is cruel sometimes,
Yes fate is so unkind
In the games
That it plays

Yes fate is cruel sometimes,
Yes fate is so unkind
In to the games of
The games of
That it plays

So now I stand beside
Beside your graveside
And I cry
I cry everyday and so till time does heal every scar
And weal I will cry every day

Until time does heal
Evey scar and weal
I will cry everyday


He loves the bearded lady she loves the tattooed man
This one he's an acrobat each one of them is damned
Jimmy the pickpocket will shake you by the hand
He'll smile at you politely but your purse it will be damned
A whore who works the fairground her name is Crystal Lil
Over there's her boy friend he'll sell you any pill
Gypsy Joe's a cut-throat when he's not out on smack
So if you want your husband killed he their throat will slash
Billy boy the barker he likes to cheat at cards
He's been caught out so many times you can see the scars
The knife thrower's got alcohol upon his breath
One day he's going to be so drunk he will cause a death
The gypsies they are dancing, dancing to the moon
And each one in this fairground each one they are doomed


The lion he has got false teeth, the fire eater is a cheat
The exotic dancer is antique.
The high-wire artist smashed his nose, the dancing bears got gangrened toes,
And all the artists need new clothes.
Cut price is the acrobat, the fortune teller is a hack, the clown's make-up is all cracked
Half the staff are pimps and whores, too old to do it any more,
They're all old, twisted, bitter and poor

The boss drinks like an unblocked drain, his wife is stupid, ugly, vain
And they're so broke they should elope to Spain
The big top it has got more holes than a dart board it's so old,
The top is rancid, green with mould.

It's the cheapest show you've ever seen
With drop-outs, drug addicts, old queens
It's garish, gaudy, cheap and obscene.


Isn't it rich, aren't we a pair
Me here at last in the ground, and you in mid-air
Send in the clowns

Isn't it bliss, don't you approve
One who keeps tearing around, and one who can't move
Well where are the clowns
Send in the clowns

Just when I stopped opening doors,
Finally knowing, the one that I wanted was yours
Making my entrance with unusual flair,
Sure of my lines but no one is there

Don't you like farce, my fault I fear
I thought that you wanted what I wanted, sorry my dear
But where are the clowns
Quick, send in the clowns
Don't bother, they're here

Isn't it rich, isn't it queer,
Losing my timing this late in my career
And where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns
Well maybe next year


In the fairground Pretty Lisa's selling candy by the bar
Pretty Lisa's training hard to be a high-wire star

Lisa's life is just a journey upon a roundabout
Everything is very pretty until the ride runs out

Dashing Tony is her trainer he got straight white teeth
Lisa thinks that he is an angel, but he's a pimp and he's a thief

Well, life is just a ride upon a roundabout
But pretty soon, that ride it will run out

Tony has his pretty Lisa tattooed from head toe
Now he's sitting in a booth with her in the freak show

Tony hits his pretty Lisa but everything is fine
The tattoos they hide the bruises every time


Ice Cream and candy floss, parents with dosh,
Those were the times I liked best
Dancing the tango with my mon amour,
Better than all of the rest.
Children they laugh, children they scream,
Parents with balloons they all beam
Money is flooding into our tills
But nothing is quiet what it seems

Circus clown

Street singers sing, pickpockets pick,
Girls on cheap wine are all sick
Lilly the prostitute parades her wares
For you she will do any trick
Jimmy is selling crack at half price
He will supply any vice
A fence, a forged document, he gives advice
On anything not very nice

Circus clown
Now you're down
In a sea of wine you have drowned


The angels in the sky well each one they do cry
Well each one they do cry for you
The angels in the sky well each one watched you die
And each one they were sad and blue

Over you
Over you

God reserves a place a very special place
A very special place for you
They angels in the sky well each one watched you die
And each one they were sad and blue

Over you
Over you

All of heaven mourns and everyone's forlorn
Each one cries their tears for you
They angels in the sky well each one watched you die
And each one they were sad and blue

Over you
Over you


The pall bearers bear the body and the body it is light
The pall bearers bear the body, it's food for maggots tonight
The pall bearers bear the body and they bear them with grief
Though each one of them is a liar a vagabond and a cheat
The pall bearers bear the body and it's real tears they cry
Though they're crying for themselves because they know they too soon will die
The pall bearers bear the body from the coal black hearse
They know each one of them bears the same gypsy curse
The pall bearers bear the body and they bear them with fear
They wonder if they too will be borne themselves this year
The pall bearers bear the body and they know they too must die
For upon each of them the same gypsy curse does lie

The pall bearers bear the body and the body it is light
There'll be food, there'll be food, there'll be food for the maggots, the maggots tonight


I'm calling out but no one will be hearing
I'm laughing but I cannot be heard
I'm crying but no one will be drying
These tears that fall

So how do we ever face a thousand violins
And how do we ever even start to begin

It's raining without a sign of stopping
It's sunny but no one's getting warm
In Heaven the harps have all been broken
And these tears they fall

So how do we ever face a thousand violins
And how do we ever even start to begin

All through the days now faded away
One thought remains one thought does stay
It haunts me still it will remain
I'm lost in wonder and I hear again

Tell me how do we ever face a thousand violins
And how do we ever even start to begin
Tell me how do we ever face a thousand violins
Tell me how do we ever even start to begin
Thousand violins


William you fool
Don't you know cards are banned

I take a car and my hand shakes
I walk a mile my body aches
I smile but no one smiles smiles at me
I am too old too old too old too old to see

And that's how it goes quick and slow
Yeah that's how it goes quick and slow

I lift a chair and my back aches
I shave my lip by mistake
My ears and eyes are going going going fast
Yet no one ever even even stops to ask

And that's how it goes quick and slow
Yeah that's how it goes quick and slow

Treated like a child now
I play my part and tow the line
My children they cannot relate
My shelf-life's past it's sell-by date

And that's how it goes yeah quick and slow
Yeah that's how it goes quick and slow

Stagger in I'm on the bus
I try hard not to not to not to make a fuss
I turn to you life is a game
Especially when you when you when you are in pain

And that's how it goes yeah quick and slow
Yeah that's how it goes yeah quick and slow

Yeah that's how it goes yeah our lives flow
Yeah that's how it goes yeah quick and slow

In a graveyard in Marseille
Where we dreamt our lives away
A long long time ago
Well I love you so

Well I know you won't be saved
By romantic words I say
But I love you so
A long long time ago

Well we're by forgotten graves
Where no one now does pray
And we hold hands which we know time
Is gonna pull away

By another's grave
Christmas cards are lain
Which say I love you so
A long long time ago

Well we're by forgotten graves
Where no one now does pray
And we hold hands which we know time
Is gonna wrench away

Underworld gangsters
Got a new design
For the coat of arms of England
I hope you feel fine

And the sunlight glistens
On the Palace of St.James
Makes us feel good
There's nothing gonna change

Memories of
A long time ago
My heart broke yesterday
Sorry I'm so slow
Without even asking
The summer's returned
If it answered some questions
Might even learn

And the sunlight glistens
On the Palace of St.James
Makes us feel good
There's nothing gonna change

Girl who caressed you's gone
Into the night
Empty pleasures
Are they worth a fight
If I could see clearly
I'd see all the time
Instead of pretending
To see when I'm blind

Hired assassins
At five pounds an hour
Well it costs a fortune
To buy a bunch of flowers
Must have been an angel
In disguise
Now a quiz show
Second prize

And the sunlight glistens
On the Palace of St.James
Makes us feel good
There's nothing gonna change

You're so stylish and you're so chic
You think you look really neat
You think you're gonna break every rule
No one's gonna make you look like a fool

You were sweet and innocent
And only seventeen seventeen
A beautiful summer's day
And so to church you rode away

Birds singing in the sky
Philosophers wondering why
While vagabonds such as I
Sing our songs and cry

And vagabonds not like me
Stare lustfully at you through the trees
They raped you took your life
With a cudgel and a knife

Little boys' blues
What can we do
We might come from Hell
But we're too young to tell
Little boys' blues
What can we do
We might come from Hell
But we're too young to tell

Found your body cold and still
Abused amongst the daffodils
God you allow this deed
Do you condone this greed

A father and a mother's grief
Are told but without release
And when they moved the young girl's head
The soil it bled

A church built where she died
How her mother and father cried
A church built on belief
A church built on grief
Little boys' blues
What can we do
We might come from Hell
But we're too young to tell

Vilification of what you said
Now all the roses are almost dead
Vilification of times gone by
Well, it's funny how we sometimes cry

One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up

Well, complications along the way
Make our bodies wanna stray
Hallelujah is on our side
Well, it's funny how we sometimes cry

One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up
One day we'll wake up

Well, I don't know if it's the beginning
Or if it is the end
I don't know if you're my enemy
Or if you are my friend
I don't know if this is good,
I don't know if this is bad
I don't know if you're happy
Or if you're sad

One day we'll wake up

People all imagine
As they're marching through the square
As they're running for the Tube train
That could take them anywhere

Do you think and imagine
Where exactly that is
Will they kiss

Well I dream of overtime
Rush hour trains that will be mine
I dream of overtime and
Rush hour trains and parking fines

We stand line by line
Everybody's feeling fine
Tickets in our hands
So many dreams and plans

We dream nine to five
It's better than a Soho dive
It's better than anything anything

We dream of overtime and
Rush hour trains that will be mine

Tyrants and conquerors
Continue to rage
While those who want justice
Dance on their graves

While family albums
Continue to bulge
With family people
Who will indulge

Holy men living
Stainless and pure
All of these things
They have to endure

Happy memories
With family and friends
Births joyful beginning
Death's grief at the end

While sad sex gods
Continue to fair
Greed in their stomach
And desire in their hair

Holy men living
Stainless and pure
All of these things
They have to endure


Got a set of golden handcuffs
Got a set of golden chains
Live in a prison called a penthouse
Where the inmates drink champagne

Got a set of plastic handcuffs
Got a set of plastic chains
Live in a prison called a slum
But it wouldn't matter if that was to change

Because you were born to fail
You were born to fail
You were born you were born

You're doing a lot of time
About seventy years
And it's full of suffering
And strife and stress and fear

I've read the softback and magazine
I've been to Manchester and in between
I've felt lust like no tomorrow
All it did was bring me buckets full of sorrow

And the angels gave me such a beating
As the angels knew that I was cheating

And the angels gave me such a beating
As the angels knew that I was cheating


You really think that innocence
Is just a word
When you smile at me it seems
So absurd

You're so full of ambition
Pride and desire
If I told you it's all meaningless
Would you call me a liar

And it don't mean a thing

Record company mogul
Queuing in your room
Makes you so excited
It makes you swoon

You trip the light fantastic
And think you are the Queen
Then somebody tells you
That you can't even sing

And it don't mean a thing

I'll miss you like a matchbox
That's gone off in my face
Lost your marbles long ago
Now you're off in space

The prison wardens ghetto blaster
Is making quite a noise
Well the day you lost everything
You lost your equipoise

And it don't mean a thing
And it don't mean a thing


Loneliness is something which many do fear
If you wish to rise over those that do care
Sweetness is something which many do show
But you can control the way that it goes

So you can scowl at people before they scowl at you
If they scowl first then you know what to do

So we enter we're all the same
Those that win or lose or stay the same
There's nothing worthwhile there's nothing sane
Playthings and enemies and losses and gains

Well this person's right and this person's wrong
Except over there where the right turns to wrong

Yeah the right turns to wrong
Yeah the right turns to wrong
Yeah the right turns to wrong
Yeah the right turns to wrong

So you can scowl at people before they scowl at you
If they scowl first then you know what to do


As the moon shines over Soho,
The thieves all settle down,
And a corpse is floating downstream,
Well I wonder, how it drowned.
And the moon shines on a body
And that body oozes blood;
Is it Macky, with his switch-blade,
Or is it an act of God?
Well, the moon shines over Shoreditch
And the bells of bow did shine,
And an old dog sucks the marrow from a bone,
The human kind.
Well, the moon shines on a corpse,
And a body is unearthed;
Was it Macky, with his switch-blade,
Or was plague or cholera the curse?
Well, the moon shines in the gutter,
And a rich man's stomach floats,
And the rich man's purse is empty,
Was it Macky that made him croak?
As the moon shines over Soho,
And the thieves all settle down,
And a corpse is floating downstream,
Well I wonder, how it drowned.
Well it's... Macky
Back in town.


Why was my father so nasty?
Why did he beat me up?
Why did he abuse me daily,
Threaten my throat to cut?
Why did he... beat up my mother,
Beat up my mother, as well?
Why did he make both of our lives
Into a living Hell?

Why? Why? Why? Why?

Why did he punch me in the face,
And punch my mother as well?
Why did he leer and smile at us,
As the bruises on our faces did swell?
Why did I stab him in the back,
Laugh as he shouted out?
Why did he bleed on the carpet?
Why does his blood all spurt out?

Why? Why? Why? Why?

Why as we followed, followed his hearse,
Why did his memory we curse?
Why did we spit on his coffin,
As they lowered it into the earth?
Why did they arrest me,
Lock me away in a cell?
Why did my mother die of a broken heart,
After feeling unwell?

Why? Why? Why? Why?

Why did they lock me up,
When I was his victim and slave?
Well, when I get out of this prison cell,
I'm going to go and piss on his grave!


I murdered Mary,
With my stiletto heel,
I thrust it through her heart,
And laughed as she did squeal.
I murdered Joseph
In exactly the same way,
And after they buried Joseph,
I pissed upon his grave.

Pissed... pissed... pissed... pissed...

I murdered the disciples
In a frenzied knife attack,
I sneaked up behind them
And I stabbed them in the back.
I murdered John the Baptist
In exactly the same way,
And after they buried John the Baptist,
I pissed upon his grave.

Pissed... pissed... pissed... pissed...

And then I went up to Heaven,
St Peter let me in,
I stabbed St Peter
As he forgave me for my sins.
I murdered the Good Shepherd
In exactly the same way,
And after they buried the Good Shepherd,
I pissed upon his grave.

Pissed... pissed... pissed... pissed...

And then I went to God,
I went to Number One,
I murdered God,
And God, it was fun.
I murdered God
In exactly the same way,
And after they buried God,
I pissed upon his grave.

Pissed... pissed... pissed... pissed...

And then I went down to Hell,
Where Satan was my friend...
But then Satan too
Came to a sticky end.
I murdered Satan
In exactly the same way,
And after they buried Satan,
I pissed upon his grave.

I pissed I pissed I pissed ...


A cripple, a leper, a blind man,
Homeless, brain-damaged, antique,
The king of the beggars, he walks in the street,
And these are the words that he speaks:

"My daughter, my daughter,
Her we adore,
She's earning good money,
She's a hard-working whore.

No legs, no arms, we're blind, and can't speak,
We beg that your heart it grows weak."
The king of the beggars, he walks in the street,
And these are the words that he speaks:

"My daughter, my daughter,
Her we adore,
She's earning good money,
She's a hard-working whore;
Well, we live and we work in the street..."


Mary's in the back room,
She's more than I can afford,
Mary's going down,
Going down on the Lord.
Mary's had the bishop,
Mary's had the Pope,
And each one of them
Filled Mary with religious hope.

Yes, Mary's going down on the Lord
(On the Lord)
Yeah, Mary's going down on the Lord
(On the Lord).

Well, Mary's had an angel,
And Mary's had a saint,
And Mary had the Devil,
And he made her feel faint.
As each one of those
Mary she does grope,
Mary's always filled
With religious hope.

Mary's going down on the Lord
(On the Lord) ...

Mary attends to all their holy needs,
And they all fill Mary
With their holy seed.
They're so generous
With their collection tins,
That Mary she feels purged
Of all her mortal sins.

Mary's going down on the Lord
(On the Lord) ...

Well, Mary's most regular,
He's a holy monk,
Mary swears that monk
Has got a reservoir of spunk.
She dresses for him
As a holy nun,
But always fakes it
When his kingdom comes.

Mary's going down on the Lord ...


There's a beggar queen
And a bandit,
This is their wedding song.
Well, they're dancing,
For the Devil,
For the Devil, he is strong.
Polly Peacham, what a beauty,
She has had five thousand men.
And Macky, her new husband,
He has murdered some of them.
Macky's strutting, a fine husband,
He's a good pimp for his whore.
He likes to have her daily,
After she has had a score.
Polly Peacham, what a beauty,
She knows her right from her wrong.
There's a beggar queen
And a bandit,
And this is their wedding song.


When we were young we killed the foreign fellows,
They spoke in strange tongues and were brown or yellow.
We'd make mincemeat of 'em and when each one was a corpse,
Then for their killings we'd be heroes, of course.
Well now you're Chief of Police and I am King of Thieves,
And each one in our own career something achieved,
Though both from the gutter were conceived,
Well now, with respect we are received.

We are the police
(We are the police)
We are the thieves
(We are the thieves)
And each the other does need.
We are the police
(We are the police)
We are the thieves
(We are the thieves)
And each the other does need.

When we were young we went and joined the army,
Those were the days, they were all so balmy.
Those young girls we would rape to shut them up
Their mouths we'd sellotape,
To keep 'em quiet while them we did rape.
Ha ha ha ha!
So now our lives could become a success,
Power and influence and money in excess.
You're the Chief of Police and I'm the King of Thieves,
And each in our own career something achieved.

We are the police
(We are the police)
We are the thieves
(We are the thieves)
And each the other does need ...


A nice man came on Monday,
He was so good and kind,
She almost felt a twinge of guilt
When she had robbed him blind.
A nice man came on Tuesday,
Rich, gentle and good,
She put him so much into debt,
He lost his livelihood.

But, when a bastard came along,
A bastard through and through,
Then she loved that bastard,
She loved that bastard true.

A nice man came on Wednesday,
Macky slit his throat,
And after he had slit it,
He sold his hat and coat.
A nice man came on Thursday,
She said him she did love,
Until the money, it ran out,
Then she him gave the shove.

But, when a bastard came along,
A bastard through and through,
Well, then she loved that bastard,
She loved that bastard true.


Don't marry them for love, my dear,
They're all just rotten swine,
And if they know you love 'em,
Then they will rob you blind.
But if their bank account is fat,
And they're all fairly kind,
Then that's a man, Polly dear,
To marry every time.
The marrying kind, the marrying kind.

Don't marry them for lust, my dear,
Their lust will soon dim,
And then there's no money, dear,
There's nothing left to win.
But if their bank account is fat,
And they're all fairly kind,
Then that's a man, Polly dear,
To marry every time.
The marrying kind, the marrying kind.

Just marry for them for money, dear,
It makes the world go round,
And if their conversation's dull,
Don't let it get you down.
If their bank account is fat,
Let your... fingers wrap around.
Money, money, money, money,
It makes the world go round;

Money, money, money, money,
Money, money, money, money,
Makes the world go round;
Money, money, money, money,
Money, money, money, money,
Makes the world go round;
Money, money, money, money,
Money, money, money, money,
Makes the world go round;
Yes, money, money, money, money,
Money, money, money, money,
Makes the world go round.
The marrying kind, the marrying kind ...


He depends upon you, baby,
You are the one he loves,
Your well-manicured hand
Will to him ruin shove.

He depends upon you, baby,
He depends upon you, baby.

He depends upon you, baby,
You are the one he needs,
Though you don't give a shit for him,
You'll bring him to his knees.

He depends upon you, baby ...

He depends upon you, baby,
Though your motive is greed,
You'll take his last penny,
You'll watch his fortune bleed.

He depends upon you, baby ...

He depends upon you, baby,
Your pimp'll slit his throat,
And leave him in the gutter,
His last moments to grope.

He depends upon you, baby ...

He depends upon you, baby,
Though you're his heart's desire,
He'd rather you abuse him
Than let his love expire.

He depends upon you, baby ...

Though in many ways a man
To goodness does aspire,
That all comes to nothing
When his passion catches fire.

He depends upon you, baby,
He depends upon you, baby.
He depends upon you, baby,
He depends upon you, baby.
He depends upon you, baby,
He depends upon you, baby.


Fisheads in the gutters,
The whores are old and tired.
Sailors are tellin' tales,
Sailors are all liars.
The fisheads are their only meal,
They lie in their stomachs and congeal.

Fisheads (fisheads),
Fisheads (fisheads),
Fisheads (fisheads),
Fisheads (fisheads),
Fisheads, those fisheads.

Thieves go out thieving,
The old men expire.
The seagulls scream obscenities
From the churches' spires.
And the fisheads are their only meal,
They lie in their stomachs and congeal.

Fisheads (fisheads) ...

The street singers sing,
Their throats on fire,
And the crucifixes fall
From the church's spire.
And the fisheads are their only meals,
They lie in their stomachs and congeal.

Fisheads (fisheads) ...

And the police round up the thieves,
Kick them about.
The thieves all scream
And the thieves all shout.
And the fisheads, they vomit them out,
Those fishheads scream and shout.

Yeah, fisheads (fisheads) ...


Well, the moon shined on that little place,
Where my darling and I lived.
If someone fancied darling,
Then I would hurt to him give.
And when he'd had his pleasure,
I'd climb back in the sheets,
And laugh, and take the piss,
Even if he'd been quite sweet.
Sometimes she'd had twenty a day,
Her money she'd give out.
Occasionally a slap or punch
I would have to mete out.
If she ever argued,
Or she started to doubt,
Then darling, darling, darling,
Darling, darling - I'd clout.
Well, the moon shined on that little place,
Where my darling and I lived.


So here I am in jail again,
Oh God, it stinks of piss.
I've been in here since I was young,
So I can reminisce...
It's looking rather grim this time,
It's looking rather bad;
But if I swing tomorrow
In some ways I'll be glad.
There's Johnny, Jim, Bill, and Fred,
I've seen them all before.
We spend our lives inside this place,
Twenty years or more.
Well, we're all rather stupid,
We're all rather dumb;
We've all come from the gutter
And we've stayed as lowlife scum.
We could've made a break for it,
Said no to being bad;
So if I'm hung tomorrow,
In some ways I'll be glad.


Your suicides,
You do them with pride,
You do them every year:
You hang yourself
From the branch of a tree,
The branch it breaks, I fear.

Your suicides,
You do them with pride,
That hotel in King's Cross:
You overdosed
On heroin,
Till the use of a limb you lost.

Your suicides,
You do them with pride,
That time you slashed your wrists:
Your blood it clotted
Quickly,
Your blood was just too thick.

Your suicides,
You do them with pride,
In your car with exhaust fumes:
Some nosy parker
Came along,
Your suicide was doomed.

Your suicides,
You do them with pride,
But are you really sincere?
You say some day you will succeed
But you're ninety-three next year.

Yes, you're ninety-three (silly old sod, silly old sod),
You're ninety-three (silly old sod, silly old sod),
You're ninety-three next year (silly old sod, silly old sod).
Yes, you're ninety-three (silly old sod, silly old sod),
You're ninety-three (silly old sod, silly old sod) ...


That fucking bitch, she thought
She could get the better of me.
Well if I can't have my Macky,
Then why the fuck should she?
I'd rather fuck up others' lives
Than let them fuck up mine,
I'd rather see them suffering
Than having a good time.
That fucking bitch, she thought
She could steal that man of mine.
Well tomorrow Macky hangs,
He hangs from the line.

Well Macky, I did love you,
I loved you more than she.
That bitch she won't have you
If you won't be with me.

I'd rather watch you drown
Than with her watch you swim.
I just can't stand losing you
And let that bitch win!


You wonder, how we're able,
With bread upon our table,
To be wise.
Well, crime is for the starving,
So let us all get carving,
We're wise.
Lock the thieves and beggars up,
For them, well, we don't give a fuck -
We're wise.
Well, crime is for the poor,
And if you aren't poor any more
You're wise.
We're middle class and wealthy,
Our bank accounts are healthy,
We are wise.
All the milk of human kindness,
Well, we've put all that behind us,
We are wise.
Well, those beggars, whores, and thieves,
None of them fool me
We're wise.
Well, we all make a living,
The strong, we don't like giving,
We're wise.
We're... wise.


They're building the gallows outside my cell,
I got twenty-five minutes to go.
The whole town's waiting to hear me yell,
I got twenty-four minutes to go.
Well, I tried the governor and the whole damn bunch,
I got twenty-three minutes to go.
And I tried the mayor, but the mayor's out to lunch,
I got twenty-two minutes to go.
They've given me beans for my last meal,
I got twenty-one minutes to go.
Nobody's asked me how I feel,
I got twenty minutes to go.
Well, the sheriff said he's gonna watch me die,
I got nineteen minutes to go.
Well, I spit in his face, and I spit in his eye,
I got eighteen minutes... to go.

Well, the preacher's come to save my soul,
I got thirteen minutes to go.
Well, he's talking about burning but I feel cold,
I got twelve minutes to go.
Well, they're testing the trap, it chills my spine,
I got eleven minutes to go.
Well, the trap and the rope are both working fine,
I got ten minutes to go.
I'm waiting for the pardon that will set me free,
I got nine minutes to go.
But nobody's remembered me,
I got eight more minutes to go.

Well, I've seen the mountains and the sky,
I got five minutes to go.
And they're so pretty, I don't wanna die,
I got four more minutes to go.
Well, my feet are in the trap, my neck is in the noose,
I got three minutes to go.
Oh, will somebody please cut me loose,
I got two more minutes to go.
Well, I heard the buzzards, I've seen the crows,
I got one minute to go.
And now I'm swinging, and here I go,
I go, I go, I go...


I forgive all of you bastards,
Who've put me here
Today.
May each one
Of you die,
In a nasty,
Painful way.
The whores,
Who have betrayed me,
A curse,
To all your flesh.
May the pox eat
Each one of you,
Lead you to a
Painful death.
The police who have
Betrayed me,
My friendships
They have betrayed.
On duty
In dark alleys,
May all of you
Be slayed.
May your family
Be fried,
In an arsonist's
Revenge.
May each one of you
Be consumed
In a painful end.
May the beggars
And the thieves
Who stand watching me today,
May each one of you die
In a nasty,
Painful way.
We're all rats
In the sewer,
And we all
End the same.
In this nasty,
In this nasty,
In this nasty,
Little ga-a-a-a-a-a-a-me.


As we go along life's way
There'll be blue skies, there'll be grey,
But your good times will be mine,
Everything's divine.

Laugh away, when we play,
Cry with me on the sad days,
You and me we are entwined,
Everything's divine,

Everything's divine.
As we go along life's way
There'll be blue skies, there'll be grey,
But your good times will be mine,
Everything's divine,
Everything's divine,
Everything's divine.


A cop he leers at Louis as he sees him in the street
Louis he sells watches a man has got to eat
The watches are legit is Louis' usual claim
The cop he laughs at Louis it's a game
So there among the fish heads Marseille is the town
The cop he cuffs up Louis, Louis going down
Louis knows that crime crime it never pays
But Louis hates the sea and that's his trade
Four brothers to the sea each one he has lost
So if it's off to prison he will bare the cost
Fish heads in the gutter Marseille is the town
Louis Louis Louis going down


And so you sailed the sea when you were twenty three
Press ganged one night how you did fight into the navy
Press ganged to mutiny
Your fate gets worse you see
And so welcome your new career
A pirate on the sea
Your captain he was cruel nine tails and foulest gruel
Then you are caught convicted of the crime of piracy
Your last words you do say a victim dies today
So now you croak upon a rope tied to a hanging tree


In the red Chicago sunset
I could smell his rotting bones
I could smell greed and corruption
The old corpses gently moan
In the red Chicago sunset
The cars they gently drone
While in cement foundations
Lie the victims now unknown
In the red Chicago sunset
I dream I hear the phone
And on the other end of it
Is that horse thief Al Capone
Do you want to buy some liquor
Do you want to buy a cop
Or buy a politician
In America we shop
In the red Chicago sunset
I can only cry
Chicago Chicago
You're built on vice and lies


Raped a girl stabbed her brother
Killed her father and her mother
Looking now to rape another
Burnt a church down near the quay
Thrown some children out to sea
He'll kill you and he'll kill me
Aliye in the morning
His dinner he does vomit out
Foul obscenities he shouts
Now he's foaming at the mouth
He'll bite you like a rabid dog
He shits himself like he's a hog
He's pissing in the face of God
Aliye in the morning
What shall we do with the drunken sailor
Put him in the long boat until he's sober


On the portside Luis Miller, Luis Miller's losing blood
On the portside with his wallet looking for a little love
On the portside Lisa Jennings has been raped and robbed again
On the portside Lisa's pimp was getting drunk again
On the portside Billy Boysson's face is a bloody pulp
That'll teach him in Jackie's on her rum to gulp
On the portside drag queen Lilly sings shanties with no names
While three boys fuck a captain three boys on the game
On the portside seagulls on last night's vomit feed
While another murder victim in the gutter slowly bleeds


A Sailor came to town
A little seaside town
He courted there a country girl
Until her heart he had found
When she in love gave him
Her body and her limbs
He took her avariciously
When he performed the sin
The sailor left the town
Left her in grief unbound
Nine months went by
In labour then a baby boy was found
They say the sailor was the devil in disguise
He cast a spell on the young girl
Seduced her with his lies
They say he was his spawn
The devils so deformed
No mercy for the mother then
A devils child stillborn
The mother took her child with anguish crazed was she
And threw herself along with child into the raging sea


In tattoo parlours by the shore
They do anchors by the score
Neptune and mermaids and girls from far away
In tattoo parlours by the shore

In massage parlours by the shore
They do sailors by the score
Even when business stank forty they'd wank
In massage parlours by the shore

In funeral parlours by the shore
Business is rarely poor
Marble slabs sagging with drownings and stabbings in
Funeral parlours by the shore


The whaler goes on out to sea
The bats are in the belfry
Captain Bligh harpoon in hand
Cat-o-ninetails every man
Captain Bligh meets his end
Eaten up by revenge
Eaten up full of hate
Grisly is his fate
Moral given never learnt
If you hate you'll be burnt
Every man on board is damned
Each one knows it every hand
No man here forgets his past
When Captain Bligh is dead at last


The cadavers they are smelling down by elysian fields
The water's been corrupted and the people do feel ill
The death carts visit visit your house today
To take away the loved ones who have passed away
The plague it shows no mercy on whom it does take
It has no sense of justice
The evil can escape
And after it has gorged itself on your loved one's flesh
It will disappear until it strikes afresh


On the portside whores are singing
While the rubbers they are flinging
From a night of fornicating
From a night of lubricating
With sailors far away
While the sun it is setting
The fishermen are netting
The whores, sperm they are begetting
The whores, sperm they are forgetting
Of sailors far away
And the sailors they are itching
Their syphilis is twitching
A gift Of those bewitching
Whores now far away
The sailors they are singing
For soon they will be drowning
In the sea on which they're sailing
Their lives they will be failing
On seas now far away


In Jackie's bar is where the sailors they all drink
And when next day it opens Jackie's always stinks
The sailors they all vomit their guts out on her floor
Next morning with her mop she cleans it from the floor
In Jackie's bar the sailors the sailors they all fight
And if there's not a stabbing it's been a quiet night
Sometimes sailors bleed to death there upon her floor
Murdered by a pimp they didn't pay a whore
The whores they sit in Jackie's legs on table tops
Showing off their wares to anyone who'll stop
The whores who work in Jackie's are the cheapest ones around
You always get a dose of clap when on one you go down


Old Johnny he's seen mermaids
When he ran aground
They carried him ashore
When he was sure to drown
They say old Johnny's mad
Seawaters turned his head
But he alone survived
All his colleagues dead
Old Johnny's seen King Neptune
In the wildest storm
He alone survived
While sailing round the horn
He carried him to safety
While all around him died
Now Johnny's telling stories
At the old portside
Old Johnny's been at sea
60 years or more
He's sailed a million miles
And fucked a thousand whores
He's heard King Neptune sing
He's heard the mermaids cry
They'll take him out to sea
When it's his turn to die


Under skull and bones to always be alone
A killer storm might break or do the gallows wait
To never see your home always you will roam
To die on some far shore worse than the lowest whore
Skull and crossed bones
On each port you call the lowest of them all
Get syphilis for sure with each one of these whores
Then out you go again till death becomes a friend
You rob and steal and maim until you get the same


O what a lovely set of cards,
Huge trees with lights and balls and yards
And yards of tinsel hung in loops
And little children rolling hoops
With stripy scarves behind them flapping,
While indoors cats and dogs are napping,
Stretched out on rugs before the fire.
Here's one that's definitely dire,
A lurid cromolitho is showing
Some huddled cows on whom it's snowing.
Inside there is a lengthy letter
That all's for worse and not for better.
It's from the Hipdeep family,
All victims of calamity.
If I am right from other years,
I'll read aloud - prepare for tears


A is for Arsenic someone thought fun
To include in the icing on top of a bun.
B is for bats that swoop out of the air
And squeaking inaudibly catch in one's hair.
C is for cord of a moderate length,
To hang oneself with it requires no great strength.
D, E, F, G, H, I, J
K is for Kris with a blade that is wavy,
One wonders why somebody smeared it with gravy.
L's for a letter that lay in a trunk,
Its contents explain how the dinghy was sunk.
M is for madhouse where is confined
A lady whose friends say she's out of her mind.
N, O, P
Q is for quilt wrapped around a dead torso,
A sick-making sight could scarcely be more so.
R is for Ray's wicked invention,
Dissolves at a distance the parts you don't mention.
S is for suicide so it would seem,
But then who was it uttered that unfinished scream.
T, U, V, W, X
Y is for yonder where someone is lying,
Which proves, seen close, to be somebody dying.
Z is for zero, the hour of doom,
It will strike any minute but no one knows to whom.


One morning in the attic Theodora's mother told her to play,
She saw their furniture being taken away.
She presently found she had been locked in,
Some bats woke up and heard her sobbing.
The house empty they helped her escape
By a window which with their wings they did break.
By the edge of a dump they found a new place to live
Then a music hall turn they worked up and did.
In the provinces the act they first broke,
Theodora played castanets, the bats walked the tightrope,
Theodora danced, the bats played guitars,
And as a finale then they somersaulted up into the stars.

The weeping chandelier

Between performances Theodora knitted sweaters for the bats,
Soon all over Europe large crowds they did attract.
Then one afternoon at a charity tango tea
Theodora met the Duque de Sangree
The Duke showed Theodora his magic chandelier
That wept when dancers they appeared.
Every time a waltz or a tango was played.
Several weeks later their betrothal was made,

The weeping chandelier

Theodora's mother saw her wedding photo,
She found the daughter she had lost so long ago.
But sadly the end is not happy to tell
Theodora's mother from a balcony fell.
Theodora's father while grieving fell off a cliff,
The bats all drowned on board a ship.
The Duke was eaten by a shark,
Theodora died of a broken heart.

The weeping chandelier


Which goes to show what's most despised
May well one day be highly prized.
The Sniggles back in '45
One day went out for a ride.
'Omletta, get in the back seat',
Said Uncle to his little niece,
'But on the windshield is Jesus'.
'Omletta, don't be ridiculous.'
But neither sponge nor razor blade
Any effect on the windshield made.
When Father Slackjaw he pass by.
Mother Mary she asked why
'Look at Jesus', said the little girl,
The priest said 'it's a miracle'.
The windshield is put in the village hall,
And all the newspapers are called
The crowds they grew, how they grew.
Miracle cures they had them too,
Ice creams, T-shirts, plates and cups,
The sales figures went up and up.
The Sniggles built a house and smiled,
Carpeted it in shaggy pile,
But sadly Omletta she did die,
But it's a moral certainty
That sometime
At the end of this century
Or the beginning of the next
She will soon be canonised.


Her husband left Goola Flibbage before the baby was weaned
To support herself and Florabelle as a charwoman she cleaned
She thought there had never been such a beautiful child, her friends they did concur,
She wondered how beautiful she would look in a costume of white bunny fur.
As she could afford each of them, she bought a tam, mittens and a little cape
A necklet, booties, and to complete the ensemble a muff with a funny shape.
The first coolish day of autumn she dressed Florabelle in them all,
She left her outside a greengrocer when on him she did call.
A pack of wild dogs came round the corner, the butchers their intention,
They ripped Florabelle to pieces in a second


To him remarked his fiancée
As he was set to go away,
"Whatever peril you are in
Swear you won't resort to gin".
Once he arrived in regions far
He went to visit the bazaar.
Against the fearful native din
He thought to take a sip of gin,
When he, arrayed in khaki pants,
Would go out hunting elephants.
The sun would make his head spin,
He took a thermos full of gin
As fierce uprisings were put down.
Time after time inside the town
He celebrated every win
By toasting all his troops in gin.
He mumbled "I'm awfully tired",
Then shortly after he expired,
But not before one last tin
Of something that was labelled gin.
His fiancée came with a wreath
Where he was laid six feet beneath,
Abandoned by his kith and kin
Because he had succumbed to gin.


At the turn of the last century an unusual pig was reared.
While others wallowed in the mud on vans' letters he peered,
While others wallowed he taught himself to read
From an abandoned library edition the works of Regera Dowdy.
To escape the usual fate of pigs he fled to London town,
He lived off garbage here and there and read every poster found.
One day he answered the rhetorical question of a passing boy,
Now in the fairground his skills they are employed.
He was put to sit on a bucket in front of a banner
To answer stupid questions in a profound manner.
Soon he'd heard each question, each question before,
So now in the fairground he's starting to get bored.
One day in mid-answer passed a troupe of festive pigs,
He got down, got run over and now no longer lives.
He's up there in pig heaven, up there in the sky,
He reads to all the other pigs, the other pigs who have died.


Hertha Strubb - where can she be?
She would have been just twenty-three.
Was she murdered by cut-throats lurking in her room?
Why did she not return on that Sunday afternoon?
Did she elope with a man she'd been seen with in November?
To an early grave did he send her?
Did she join an obscure religious cult,
With ritual mass suicide as the result?
Was she burned as a heretic at the stake,
Or does she lie in the baptist cemetery in Ohio state?
Does she suffer from amnesia, live in another state?
Does she lie bleeding on a mendicant knife-grinder's floor?
Or did she perish on some rocky shore?
Did she fall down a manhole left open by mistake?
Or did she choke on a piece of fruit cake?


No sooner were they bound in marriage
When they realized their mistake
And as they got into the carriage
Each pondered what steps to take.
The honeymoon was merely dreary
And by the time that it was through
Their brains were overwrought and weary,
Contemplating what to do.
They reached their villa numb with loathing
As it was fading into night,
They cast aside their outer clothing,
And parted mutely for the night.
At dawn with scissors she came creeping
Into his room and deftly sheared,
While he lay strenuously sleeping,
Uneven notches in his beard.
Then after they had been wedded
A dozen years they paused aghast,
The possibility they had dreaded
Had occurred, occurred at last
They had exhausted all the other
Revenges for existing wrongs,
So they fell on one another,
Him with hammers, her with tongs.
A week went by, a tradesman calling
Peered in and gave a sickened gulp,
For on the carpet they were sprawling,
A single horrid heap of pulp.


The sky went dark
When from the park
Came gasps of agony.
A common pin,
It did him in,
Was dipped in QRV.

On the left bank
She quickly sank
Into depravity.
She later died
Of suicide
From drinking QRV.

They found him dead
Upon his bed
Contorted horribly
His breath was still
His lungs were filled
With fumes of QRV

With grief her life
Was strangely rife
Her children died at sea
In failing health
She sank her wealth
In shares of QRV

With carving knives
They lost their lives,
Sent to eternity.
Who would suspect
A local sect
That pedalled QRV

While skipping past
A rail too fast
They perished clumsily.
What did they do
But fall into
A vat of QRV.

Among the dead
Were listless Ned,
Aunt Glou Glou,
Lady Twee,
The Woolly Flames,
And Little James,
Done in by QRV.

Who once was pretty,
Gay and witty,
A spirit wild and free,
Now lies half dead
Across the bed,
A slave to QRV.

One day she wrote
A farewell note
She wanted to be free
They found her stripped
Within her crypt
Done in by QRV

Ask not for whom
Was raised this tomb
Which stands above the sea,
But know inside
Lies one who died
From taking QRV.


One fateful day Kay's mother took her into a building lobby,
They took turns pinching and twisting her little body.
They made her stand in positions more and more bizarre,
Then they made her repeat them daily at a thing they called a barre.
They put her on a diet, they said her wrists they did appall.
And they made her wear a strange garment, a tutu it was called,
She danced her first role as a friend of La Fille mal Gardee.
After she'd been made to join a sinister group, the corps de ballet,
The critics said of her performance, 'Better you don't do',
In a fit of spite someone put ground glass, ground glass in her toeshoes.
She took the elastics from her ballet things,
Stitched them together and hanged herself in the wings.


One afternoon Lily was having an ice cream dream,
A young man with a glossy moustache approached her ingratiating and clean.
He took her for a walk in the park, inserted his finger in her... glove,
He took her to his apartment and to her he made love.
Trampled Lily, Trampled Lily.
The next morning before going out he presented her with a ruffled peignoir of gin,
After that each morning she read ladies' magazines
In the afternoon she entertained gentlemen, gentlemen on her bed,
The young man gave way to an older man with a heavy beard.
Trampled Lily, Trampled Lily.
Under the influence of a lecture from a passing senator she decided to reform,
She was placed in a back bedroom with bars like a prison dorm.
She gave birth to a defective infant placed in an orphanage overfull
And as she lost her freshness on the streets the punters she pulled.
Trampled Lily, Trampled Lily.
She was continually harassed by masculine women in black bonnets trying to set her free,
And as she reached her twentieth birthday she died a loathsome disease.


In January Cousin Fred,
We found him in the attic dead.
In February's odd adventure
Father lost his dentures.
In March Fiona had a fright
When coming home alone one night,
Some men in a long black car
Made her get in and drove her far.

In April Horace left behind
What little thought, what little mind
He may have had. In the result
He joined an unknown eastern cult,
Tattooed his ears, pierced his nose,
Glides around on henna-ed toes.
His relatives are unforgiving,
Assert he's no longer living.
The Hipdeep family.

In May Aunt Flo began to sneeze,
Which heralded some strange disease.
In June Jeffrey got himself arrested
He's still far and wide detested.
In July Mama's pin-money dwindled
Away to nought when she was swindled.
In August Bruno had a fit,
A passing tot he went and bit.
The Hipdeep family.

In September we were sad to lose
Miss Grey while on a cruise
She happened to fall overboard
Into Norway's deepest fjord.
In October Alice was betrothed
To Edgard whom she found she loathed,
His behavior ever since
Has been enough to make her wince.

In November it was rather frightning
When Baby Boo was struck by lightning,
The experts think perhaps he'll walk
And even sort of learn to talk.
And in December Amy's luck was rotten,
While singing 'Die Frau and Schatten',
Without warning lost her voice,
A twist of fate, had no choice.
The Hipdeep family.

So much for us, we hope that you
Have managed somehow to get through
The year and so can celebrate
A bit before the hands of fate
Shall get us in its grip again,
But we anticipate our Gorey end.


What is the point of this life that we lead?
The filth and the fury the neurotic need
Where are we going where does it lead?
The strife and the striving as life from us bleeds

Sin, sin

What is its point, its purpose, its goal?
Where is it going, each one plays his role?
Striving with ego to triumph to win
For wealth and for power commit any sin

Sin, sin

The stinking corpse rank with decay
A king or a duke forgotten today

Sin, sin

So thrust with your ego you will not be saved
We all end as paupers alone in our graves
Worry, hurry and fight for your rights
You'll never get there then bang, out go the lights

Sin, sin

Each action each striving a pointless game
And after it's over forgotten your name
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sin, sin



The king is dead, long live the king

Prince Hamlet is stricken with grief
His mother has married the new king
Scarcely after her old husband the old king is dead
The king is dead, long live the king

Prince Hamlet now does choke
Prince Hamlet's heart is broke
His mother copulates with the new king,
While her old husband's corpse is still warm
The king is dead, long live the king

Prince Hamlet is filled with grief
He feels as if his father has been stolen by a thief
His mother's orgasmic cries
When her old husband has just died
The king is dead, long live the king



The ides of March the knives go in
The king is dead from assassins
When power it is up for grabs
Then murder to them is not mad

You'll end up lying in your grave
Power it does so deprave
You'll end up lying in your grave
They'll risk it all to power slaves

Slaves

They don't care if you're right or wrong
They'll kill the weak respect the strong
For if you're bad or if you're good
It's power only that's understood

You'll end up lying in the soil
They'll risk it all for power toil
They'll mourn you at your death
Mouth their grief poisonous breath

Slaves

You'll end up lying in your grave
Power it does so deprave
They'll risk it all to power slaves
You'll end up lying in the soil

They'll risk it all for power toil
They'll mourn you at your death
Mouth their grief poisonous breath

Slaves

To power each one is a whore
Your guts lie bleeding on the floor
One day their turn will come to cry
And then in terror piss and cry

You'll end up lying in your grave
Power it does so deprave
You'll end up lying in your grave
They'll risk it all to power slaves

Slaves

But now they murder, murder me
Leave me on the floor to bleed
They murder without regret
For power all things
Do forget

Slaves
They are slaves


Do you believe in good and bad?
Are you happy when you're sad?
Do you believe in your fate
When you're alone?

You'll be raped you're a pawn
Your hair ripped and burned
You'll be handled crucified
When you're alone

You'll be raped left to die
No one then will for you cry
No one sees you
When you're down
You're alone

Well this life it is cruel
You're a clown
And you're a fool
Pauper's grave it waits for you
You're alone

So you're Jesus on the ropes
A messiah without hope
You're a king
Who kills the hope
You're alone

In your excrement expire
You'll burn in hellfire
Through the shit and the decay
You're alone

You're alone


Stay away from him who is not prepared to bend
Who will the powers that be happily offend
For such a man disaster it does wait
Such a man will only your young heart break

Stay away from him

Stay away from him who is not prepared to bend
Peace of mind for such a man can only be pretend
For such a man the tears you cry could fill a lake
Stay away from him for pity's sake

Stay away from him

Stay away from him who is not prepared to bend
Such a man will never to happiness be friends
Disaster will be his only fate
Death and destruction, the very earth does quake

Stay away from him


Ten men at the funeral queue
The great cadaver they do view
In the brain the blood clot
Another ten their livers rot

To be or not to be

A hundred revolution plot
Change the world without a shot
They dream of sweet revenge
Another hundred round the bend

To be or not to be

A thousand haven't got a friend
They're lonely right until the end
A thousand fires on the railway line
A thousand bottles of red wine
A hundred thousand nights divine
A hundred thousand pearls and swines

A million tears
A million fears
A million laughs
A million cheers

To be or not to be

If looks could kill a million spears
A million get me out of here
A billion heartbeats
A billion breaths
A billion pounds
They all invest

To be or not to be


1 2 3 4 just another whore
Working hard to get her score

In the cold winter rain
Cramps in her stomach
Withdrawal pains
Addiction haunt
Night and day
For her cravings she must pay

1 2 3 4 just another whore
Working hard to get her score

Cravings gnaw at her soul
Numb her guilt numb her goal
Doing anything you like
Lust or power for spite

1 2 3 4 just another whore
Working hard to get her score

Corrupt the night
Corrupt the day
For her drugs she will pay
Darkest recess of your heart
Whatever you want
Rip her apart

1 2 3 4 just another whore
Working hard to get her score

Just a whore night and day
For her drugs, she must pay
She's just meat, pass her around
Only one way, and it's down

Murder rob mug or maim
Just a whore who's on the game
In addiction she will drown
Going one way and it's down

1 - she's on the street
2 - a princess rich and chic
3 - she'll do just what you ask
4 - feed her and you can her shaft

5 - do just what you like
6 - lust for power, greed and vice
7 - you know her heart is black
8 - addictions breaks her back

9 - she's going down to Hell
10 - her morality she'll sell
1 2 3 4 just another whore
Working hard to get her score


So you betray the one who you need
The one on whom you feed
What is the profit of this?
Malice, stupidity or cowardice

Is it ego is it pride
Overpowering you from the inside
Anger, jealousy or greed
The burning vice on which you feed

Or is it really just a plan
To save your soul from the damned
Do you have mercy do you feel fine
As you drown your soul
In drugs or wine

And as you enter your decline
Will memories cloud your mind
Will you be clouded with regret
Will you believe your course was set

And as you take your dying breath
Laugh or with grief be beset
As you enter the ground
And your mourners crowd around

What memories of you they'll hold
What stories of you will be told
How long were you filled with happiness
What fears and terrors did you vex?

The sum of all these parts
You die with full or broken heart
When they remember you they laugh
Regret remorse of what has passed

So you betray the one you need


The worms they gnaw the worms they chew,
The worms are eating you
The man eats the fish, the fish eats the worm
The worm eats the prince nothing we learn

Is it true
You are broken, sick and weak
The worms queue up to you eat
Is it true

They place your body into the dirt
The worms they are waiting they're alert
The worms eat your body a fisherman comes
And into his bucket the worms they are flung

Is it true
Soon you will die
At your funeral they will cry
Is it true

The worm in the water
The fish takes a look
The fish bites the worm the fish bites the hook
The fish he can scream the fish he can shout
From the water now he's ripped out

Is it true
You are broken, sick and weak
The worms queue up to you eat
Is it true

The hook now it lies in the fish's gut
The hook is ripped out the fish's life's cut
The fish tastes so good fried in the pan
The fish is eaten by the man

Is it true
You are broken, sick and weak
The worms queue up to you eat
Is it true


So the ghost tells you, Hamlet, I'm your father dear
So if you think my death was strange,
I'll confirm your fear
I died not of natural causes Murder ruled the day
The new king was my murderer
Revenge me now I pray

Murder, murder, murder, murder rules the day

For if not our family are fools
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth
The new king cannot rule
So the ghost tells you, Hamlet, I'm your father dear
So if you think my death was strange,
I'll confirm your fear

Murder, murder, murder, murder rules the day

So the ghost tells you, Hamlet, I'm your father dear
So if you think my death was strange,
I'll confirm your fear
So the ghost tells you, Hamlet, I'm your father dear
So if you think my death was strange,
I'll confirm your fear

Murder, murder, murder, murder rules the day


Are you going mad Hamlet?

You torture every fibre of your soul for what?
A blow-job a hand-job a bead of snot
This world is filled with things corrupt
You know it's poisoned in its guts

Weak is the flesh weak is the soul
You must succumb and play a role
Nothing is pure nothing is clean
This world it is dirty and obscene

You cannot escape from the blame
Each one of us a whore is the name

Are you going mad Hamlet?

A whore wants to kill
Insanity is eating you do our guts want to spill
We live this way because there is no other way to live
For we are weak and greedy beings us you must forgive

Are you too mad Hamlet to see each of us is flawed
Each lives in a brothel each one is a whore
But Hamlet will not them forgive
Human frailty live let live

His love for father does consume
All hope for peace it is doomed
For Hamlet the disease of hate
No hope for peace just heartbreak

From all around he feels betrayed
His heart and soul are cut and flayed

Are you going mad Hamlet?


This dangerous man, we must make it clear
That his desire for revenge we do not fear

This dangerous man

Expose him daughter
See that he is bad, bad
Expose him revenge has driven him mad

This dangerous man

I fear that young Hamlet
To us is opposed
Ill-will and vengeful glances
At us he does throw

This dangerous man

I fear that murder of us
Preys now on his mind
Consumed with malice and contempt
And filled with hatred blind

This dangerous man


Is it a marble slab or on my bed I lie
As I dream of love that's pure that doesn't die
Is my love a cadaver, a train that's run its course
Are the tears that trickle down my face its suicidal force

Onward to destruction, onwards to his death
I know soon he'll draw his last breath
So as I lie and dream of him I'm on a marble slab
Each draws a hand of cards and mine have turned out bad

For some moments of happiness is all that you can dream
For me those moments too will be denied it seems
I lie upon my marble slab I dream and then I cry
I know that it's a moment

Soon all of us will die
Soon all of us will die


I'm a bordello a living bordello
I've been had by a thousand different fellows

Well actually no
I'm a Queen with a ring
Only two customers both of them kings

It's the quality not the quantity girls
When you've had kings it's all diamonds and pearls

So really girls it's best to have two
Than ten thousand men pumping in to you


When you ask these questions
They don't make any sense
You have no way to answer
You have no defence

It's all a sad charade
It all means not a thing
The fear the strife the worry
The nonsense that I sing

It's all the cloak and dagger
Are bottles in the sea
Going nowhere fast
Pointless conspiracy

You can ask any question
The answer is the same
No truth will be answered
Apart from a word game

We're bottles in the sea

The strife and the stress
A mirror it reflects back
The fear and the fury
How quickly we do crack

Ask the deepest question
As to what it all means
Nothing is the answer
It doesn't mean a thing

'Cause we're bottles in the sea
Bottles in the sea

It's just a dream
Or what it mean


Sweet suicide release me
From all of this pain
Another night of torment
Never sunshine always rain

And it never helps the kindness
That people try to show
Just makes it feel more tragic
Release me let me go

I am drowning in the greyness
Suffocating in this grief
Tell me my life is not mine to take
Go ahead, call me a thief

And it never helps the kindness
That people try to show
Just makes it feel more tragic
Release me let me go

I'm drowning in the pain
That my life does make
Broken spirit broken soul
No more can I take

I'm drowning in the moonbeams
The blackest night
Reflecting a glass
I give up the fight

Swallowed up
With no air to breathe
Broken by your words
How they deceive the poisoned by revenge
And bitter spite

I don't care if you're right
Don't care if you're wrong or right
There the water it beckons me
An early grave that waits for me

Sweet suicide release me
Release me let me go


My lover and my mentor
Now lies in her grave
And I'm left to mourn her
Whom my soul did save

I'm staring at her tombstone
My heart is full of grief
I fear that part of my life
Has been stolen by a thief

Stolen by a thief
Stolen by a thief

The elements will wear this tombstone away
And one day we will join you
Us who for you pray
The words upon your tombstone
Will be worn away
But we will be united
Somehow somewhere some day

Stolen by a thief
Stolen by a thief

As that tombstone starts to crack
From the bitter cold
And when I come to visit you
Bent double and old
My memories of love will seem like yesterday
True love never forgets
Well that is what they say

You were stolen by a thief
You were stolen by a thief

So lover dear,
I love you forever more
You, my blessed lover
Your memory I'll adore

So as the wind and snow and rain
Beats down upon your tomb
My comfort is
We'll be united one day soon

You were stolen by a thief
Stolen by a thief


The act is good
They you love
But God forbid
They try a shove

Then all the hatred
It will spill out
Abusive will
Be the shout

What's behind the happy smile
As my soul you do defile
What's behind the happy laugh

In a mirror
You do laugh
Abusive will be the shout
Then your hatred
Will spill out

You have no hope
Poisoned your soul
To keep it hidden
Is your goal

Because you know them
You do hate
You bear your cross
Grin at your fate

And when it's time
For you to die
Then to your grave
You'll take our lie


They play on you like you're a pipe
They play on you their greed and spite
They play on you a fool they say
Any tune they choose to play

There's nothing right, there's nothing wrong
It's just a desolation song

They play on you a marionette
They control you all is set
Pull the strings and watch you dance
You really didn't stand a chance

There's nothing right, there's nothing wrong
It's just a desolation song

If you were strong
If you could fight
If you could see
The day from night
If you could make out
White from black
Then they could not you attack

There's nothing right, there's nothing wrong
It's just a desolation song

You know they'll crucify you
You know that they will you screw
There's not a thing that you can do
They have got have got you

There's nothing right, there's nothing wrong
It's just a desolation song
Desolation song
